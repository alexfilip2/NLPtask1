For
those
of
us
who
were
n't
yet
born
when
the
1960
's
rock
'
n
'
roll
around
,
Monterey
Pop
afford
an
affection
glimps
of
the
music
that
influenc
our
parent
to
be
hippi
.
From
Otis
Red
to
Jimi
Hendrix
,
Jani
Joplin
to
the
Mama
and
the
Papa
,
and
Jefferson
Airplan
to
The
Who
,
this
documentari
is
jam-pack
with
contagi
energi
.
But
I
give
fair
warn
that
I
will
reveal
the
end
,
which
doe
not
do
the
rest
of
the
film
the
justic
it
deserv
.
Shot
in
1969
at
an
outdoor
concert
that
preclud
Woodstock
,
the
film
defi
the
stereotyp
of
the
general
popul
at
the
time
.
Sure
,
some
have
paint
their
face
and
smoke
joint
,
but
D.A.
Pennebak
-LRB-
The
War
Room
,
Moon
Over
Broadway
-RRB-
surpris
choos
to
show
a
broad
spectrum
of
the
audienc
.
No
matter
who
is
watch
,
it
all
come
back
to
the
talent
musician
that
stir
your
soul
.
The
excit
start
befor
the
music
even
begin
.
A
young
girl
is
clean
thousand
of
seat
and
when
ask
whi
by
an
interview
,
she
repli
that
she
feel
lucki
to
do
so
.
There
are
moment
of
organ
crazi
as
John
Phillip
,
leader
of
the
Mama
and
the
Papa
and
one
of
the
concert
organ
,
tri
to
get
in
touch
with
Dionn
Warwick
.
And
when
one
band
is
tune
up
,
a
member
remark
,
``
Final
,
a
decent
sound
system
!
''
you
can
tell
just
by
watch
these
first
few
moment
that
this
show
is
n't
about
vaniti
,
it
's
about
play
the
music
you
love
to
those
who
have
an
appreci
for
it
,
a
two-way
street
.
This
interact
between
audienc
and
perform
continu
throughout
the
film
and
becom
infecti
to
the
audienc
.
It
's
imposs
to
tear
your
eye
away
from
Jani
Joplin
as
she
belt
out
her
ballad
about
love
be
a
ball
and
chain
.
And
while
the
lyric
to
``
Wild
Thing
''
may
not
be
all
that
complic
,
watch
Jimi
Hendrix
mime
have
sex
with
his
guitar
is
as
captiv
as
Otis
Red
sing
about
love
.
Even
if
you
do
n't
recogn
everi
band
you
see
on
stage
,
you
can
imagin
be
as
enthral
by
their
work
as
the
public
sit
in
those
seat
.
The
onli
drawback
to
the
film
is
the
end
,
which
unfortun
I
must
reveal
.
All
the
other
band
,
big
name
then
and
still
today
,
got
approxim
7
to
10
minut
of
screen
time
.
In
contrast
,
the
last
band
on
camera
,
a
wholli
forgett
one
,
get
an
entir
18
minut
of
screen
time
.
For
a
film
that
's
onli
78
minut
long
,
that
's
too
larg
of
a
chunk
,
especi
when
previous
act
are
much
more
stimul
.
All
in
all
,
Monterey
Pop
is
a
precious
,
rare
look
at
a
time
period
that
still
hold
sway
over
us
.
The
varieti
of
music
,
as
well
as
the
beauti
shot
perform
,
are
easi
to
becom
immers
in
.
If
there
was
ever
ani
question
as
to
whi
most
of
these
band
were
so
popular
,
this
is
quick
dispel
.
It
's
almost
depress
to
think
that
music
this
move
doe
n't
get
made
much
anymor
.
Instead
we
re
stuck
with
*
Nsync
,
the
Backstreet
Boy
,
and
Jennif
Lopez
,
all
of
whom
should
have
stuck
with
model
.
