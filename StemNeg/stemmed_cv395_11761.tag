Meet
the
Deedl
is
not
near
as
interest
as
ani
of
those
archetyp
.
In
fact
,
it
is
an
invit
you
ought
to
disregard
.
Phil
and
Stew
Deedl
-LRB-
Paul
Walker
and
Steve
Van
Wormer
-RRB-
are
the
twin
son
of
the
famous
millionair
,
Elton
Deedl
-LRB-
Eric
Braeden
-RRB-
,
founder
of
Deedl
Enterpris
.
Elton
want
his
son
to
be
the
perfect
heir
to
his
fortun
...
instead
the
two
are
careless
Hawaiian
surf
bum
.
To
set
them
straight
,
he
enrol
them
into
a
strict
Wyom
boot
camp
,
to
which
the
pair
inevit
go
.
After
sever
misadventur
in
Wyom
,
where
the
duo
is
stun
to
discov
there
's
no
surf
,
the
brother
Deedl
stumbl
upon
a
routin
mistaken
ident
plot
.
They
arriv
at
yellowston
Nation
Park
,
where
they
are
believ
to
be
two
new
park
ranger
recruit
.
Rather
than
slink
back
home
and
disappoint
their
dad
,
the
Deedl
play
along
.
Phil
,
actual
,
has
other
motiv
:
the
beauti
park
ranger
Jess
-LRB-
A.
J.
Langer
-RRB-
,
who
unfortun
happen
to
be
the
belov
stepdaught
of
the
overprotect
Park
Ranger
Captain
Dougla
Pine
-LRB-
John
Ashton
-RRB-
.
yellowston
has
a
problem
.
It
's
onli
a
week
befor
the
famous
geyser
Old
Faith
celebr
it
one
billionth
birthday
,
and
the
park
is
be
overrun
with
prairi
dog
.
Not
just
one
or
two
...
thousand
of
them
.
The
Deedl
are
assign
to
elimin
the
P.Dog
menac
,
not
know
that
it
all
is
part
of
a
fiendish
plan
by
disgrac
former
Head
Ranger
Frank
Slater
-LRB-
Denni
Hopper
-RRB-
.
The
Brother
Deedl
are
n't
suppos
to
be
out-and-out
stupid
,
like
the
team
from
Dumb
and
Dumber
,
or
Bill
and
Ted
.
Instead
,
their
brain
just
oper
in
a
differ
,
simpler
,
realm
.
A
more
accur
comparison
would
be
with
Carrot
Top
in
Chairman
of
the
Board
,
a
film
which
,
unfortun
,
this
one
resembl
in
sever
hideous
way
.
The
central
problem
with
Meet
the
Deedl
is
that
it
simpli
just
is
n't
funni
.
There
's
a
moment
when
Phil
utter
the
line
,
``
Insert
Laugh
Here
''
,
which
near
sum
up
the
entir
Meet
the
Deedl
experi
.
The
result
is
n't
bad
in
a
run-shrieking-from-the-theat
type
of
way
.
Instead
,
it
's
mere
bad
in
an
excruci
bore
sort
of
way
.
The
cast
seem
decent
,
but
they
re
never
ask
to
do
anyth
remot
interest
.
Instead
,
the
film
inund
the
audienc
with
countless
shot
of
peopl
and/or
car
roll
downhil
in
the
forest
,
and
with
constant
annoy
refer
to
other
Disney
film
.
you
ll
have
much
better
luck
find
a
good
spot
to
surf
in
Wyom
than
find
entertain
in
Meet
the
Deedl
.
