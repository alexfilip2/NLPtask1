1996
's
SHINE
,
which
star
Geoffrey
Rush
as
pianist
David
Helfgott
,
has
a
movi
so
defiant
laid
bare
the
live
of
world-class
musician
.
In
fact
,
if
one
were
to
watch
these
film
togeth
,
it
would
almost
certain
stand
as
a
convinc
argument
that
a
life
of
music
natur
lead
to
all
varieti
of
social
ill
.
yet
HILARi
AND
JACKIE
,
the
sophomor
effort
from
director
Anand
Tucker
,
has
someth
more
to
say
--
it
soft
but
strong
explor
the
complex
relationship
of
sibl
rivalri
and
love
in
a
veri
compel
tale
.
Emili
Watson
and
Rachel
Griffith
are
the
lead
in
this
tale
,
play
the
sister
Du
Pr
.
Both
musician
from
childhood
,
Hilari
-LRB-
Griffith
-RRB-
is
renown
flutist
while
Jacquelin
-LRB-
Watson
-RRB-
is
easili
as
skill
on
the
cello
.
The
two
comepet
for
and
win
mani
honor
as
children
and
as
young
women
,
both
togeth
and
seper
.
Their
career
as
musician
surpass
and
then
bow
to
one
anoth
's
,
and
although
their
live
take
veri
differ
path
--
Hilari
settl
down
to
marriag
and
a
famili
while
Rachel
skip
across
the
globe
on
a
world
concert
tour
--
they
are
bound
togeth
by
their
deep
famili
love
.
The
perform
of
Watson
and
Griffith
are
excel
in
style
and
substanc
.
They
contrast
each
other
wonder
,
and
while
Watson
's
portray
of
Jacki
Du
Pr
is
at
time
eccentr
and
perhap
unsympathet
,
both
charact
are
charg
with
emot
.
The
Frank
Cottrel
Boyc
script
,
which
is
base
on
the
book
by
Hilari
and
Pier
Du
Pr
,
bring
a
great
deal
of
depth
to
these
charact
as
well
.
The
script
is
also
to
be
commend
for
it
well-polish
dual
natur
.
Cottrel
Boyc
adopt
a
style
which
one
might
expect
to
see
in
a
mysteri
thriller
-LRB-
which
was
in
fact
the
case
with
David
Koepp
and
Robert
Town
's
script
for
MISSION
:
IMPOSSIBLE
-RRB-
and
skill
mold
it
to
the
stori
of
two
rise
musician
on
differ
cours
to
fame
.
The
latter
part
of
his
script
are
controversi
to
say
the
least
,
and
the
rather
depress
end
take
the
wind
out
of
an
envigor
stori
.
Some
will
leav
this
movi
feel
disenfranchis
.
Nevertheless
,
HILARi
AND
JACKIE
is
a
movi
that
reach
an
upper
echelon
of
contemporari
cinema
through
solid
fundament
and
is
a
decent
watch
all
around
.
