Do
n't
let
this
movi
fool
you
into
believ
the
romant
noir
of
William
Shakespear
.
No
one
will
truli
understand
the
heart
and
soul
of
this
man
except
through
his
work
,
and
this
movi
make
a
vain
attempt
at
that
.
Ani
move
to
glamoris
'
his
life
,
which
Hollywood
has
an
annoy
tendenc
to
do
,
will
onli
subtract
from
his
achiev
rather
than
expound
on
his
great
.
This
movi
about
his
life
,
although
well
written
,
put
too
much
make-up
on
a
man
whose
life
was
probabl
more
pork
and
potato
,
rather
than
lobster
and
champagn
.
Oh
well
,
let
's
fantasis
onward
an
assum
that
he
was
a
bit
of
a
flirtati
play-writ
,
who
fall
in
love
with
a
beauti
woman
-LRB-
Gwyneth
Paltrow
-RRB-
and
from
her
inspir
,
sever
play
develop-Romeo
and
Juliet
'
,
and
The
Twelfth
Night
'
.
It
is
easier
for
me
to
believ
that
he
had
a
wet
dream
and
that
's
how
all
his
play
develop
,
but
pleas
spare
me
all
of
this
unnecessari
melodrama
.
But
I
guess
my
version
probabl
would
n't
draw
a
crowd
or
make
a
dollar
on
screen
.
So
is
there
ani
justif
in
romanticis
the
man
Shakespear
,
when
all
we
need
to
do
is
read
his
work
in
order
to
find
his
soul
.
I
think
not
.
As
for
the
Oscar
were
they
deserv
by
this
movi
?
I
think
not
.
In
mani
aspect
Privat
Ryan
'
and
Life
is
Beauti
'
were
far
superior
movi
,
but
one
should
never
assum
that
this
should
be
a
criteria
for
win
an
Oscar
,
as
time
and
again
,
for
reason
unexplain
,
an
undeserv
movi
will
win
the
accolad
.
Another
sore
point
is
the
fact
that
Gwyneth
won
the
best
femal
lead
,
over
a
more
polish
Cate
,
but
I
guess
if
you
go
on
enough
about
your
grandfath
die
and
your
nephew
be
hospitalised-peopl
will
start
feel
sorri
for
you
.
