-RRB-
Denzel
Washington
is
among
the
mani
actor
this
holiday
season
to
give
veri
impress
mileston
perform
.
This
perhap
may
be
Washington
's
veri
best
to
date
.
He
join
Matt
Damon
and
Jim
Carrey
in
have
the
talent
,
this
season
,
to
becom
his
charact
,
copi
manner
and
person
style
perfect
.
His
veri
believ
perform
make
the
long
and
uninterest
``
The
Hurrican
''
a
much
better
film
than
it
actual
is
.
When
his
Rubin
``
Hurrican
''
Carter
feel
pain
and
is
torment
by
racism
,
he
creat
for
the
audienc
a
great
sens
of
sympathi
,
disgust
,
and
mayb
even
some
embarrass
from
the
fact
that
this
is
our
veri
own
countri
that
is
break
law
to
support
silli
prejudic
.
The
horrif
true
event
Carter
suffer
from
all
of
his
life
are
slight
more
disturb
and
terrifi
becaus
they
onli
took
place
a
few
decad
ago
.
The
power
express
of
Denzel
Washington
alon
,
as
his
tortur
Carter
,
sum
up
the
troubl
of
racism
in
America
's
histori
.
He
is
that
amaz
.
The
problem
with
``
The
Hurrican
''
is
that
when
compar
to
Washington
,
all
of
the
other
actor
are
not
near
as
memor
in
their
role
.
Main
becaus
the
script
focus
so
much
on
Carter
,
that
it
leav
littl
interest
or
room
for
the
other
actor
.
This
is
,
without
a
doubt
,
Washington
's
movi
but
in
order
for
ani
film
to
be
complet
satisfi
,
it
must
util
everyon
in
the
cast
to
their
highest
potenti
not
just
the
star
.
Denzel
Washington
is
the
onli
reason
to
see
this
film
for
his
inspir
and
veri
depress
tour
de
forc
perform
.
As
Rubin
Carter
,
we
see
a
black
man
whose
exist
has
been
a
punch
bag
for
the
white
American
court
system
.
>
From
the
age
of
eleven
to
twenti
one
he
was
sent
to
a
juvenil
prison
for
a
crime
he
did
not
commit
.
Then
after
a
success
marriag
and
box
career
,
he
was
harsh
imprison
again
for
life
after
be
frame
for
a
tripl
murder
.
Carter
's
second
term
in
prison
seem
almost
inevit
when
face
off
against
jealous
,
power
white
men
who
refus
to
let
him
succeed
.
From
these
past
experi
in
jail
,
Carter
realiz
that
he
must
make
his
case
heard
for
all
of
America
.
After
sever
court
appeal
,
an
autobiographi
,
and
mani
public
march
for
his
freedom
,
Carter
remain
lock
in
prison
.
It
was
not
until
a
young
black
boy
from
Brooklyn
be
educ
in
Toronto
read
Carter
's
book
in
the
1980
's
,
that
a
serious
battl
for
freedom
took
place
.
The
young
boy
and
his
three
Canadian
guardian
decid
to
dedic
all
of
their
time
to
the
case
until
Carter
is
releas
.
The
greatest
scene
in
the
film
are
when
Carter
begin
to
lose
his
mind
after
spend
three
month
in
isol
.
Washington
realli
show
the
breakdown
of
Carter
when
after
swear
he
would
never
go
to
jail
again
,
he
is
unfair
frame
at
the
height
of
his
innoc
career
.
The
devast
in
Washington
's
eye
show
a
man
who
has
struggl
to
do
the
right
thing
his
whole
life
onli
to
be
punish
for
it
.
In
the
hole
,
Carter
attempt
to
maintain
emot
balanc
but
he
can
not
.
His
anger
is
heighten
to
a
point
of
no
control
.
We
see
multipl
Carter
,
a
violent
angri
one
,
a
silent
passiv
one
,
and
a
mediat
.
We
see
an
emot
box
match
insid
Carter
's
head
.
From
this
point
in
the
hole
to
the
end
of
the
film
,
this
fight
continu
.
It
is
veri
appar
at
time
which
side
is
win
the
battl
and
in
some
scene
there
is
a
direct
switch
from
angri
to
care
or
the
opposit
.
When
Carter
see
that
white
Canadian
want
to
help
him
get
out
of
prison
,
the
angri
Carter
at
first
erupt
.
White
peopl
have
been
tri
to
hurt
him
his
whole
life
,
this
remind
lead
to
anger
in
his
head
.
Howev
,
as
the
film
continu
and
the
Canadian
continu
to
help
Carter
we
see
the
calm
side
him
.
He
realiz
that
societi
is
chang
.
That
racism
is
decreas
and
now
Carter
want
to
leav
jail
immedi
and
becom
a
part
of
this
world
.
Veri
rare
have
I
seen
such
determin
to
perfect
his
role
as
Washington
has
done
here
.
If
onli
the
other
actor
had
this
same
determin
.
Dan
Hedaya
,
ridicul
play
the
man
who
send
Carter
to
prison
twice
by
forc
wit
to
lie
and
switch
evid
around
.
It
felt
like
his
charact
was
taken
straight
out
of
a
``
Scoobi
Doo
''
episod
;
he
would
have
gotten
away
with
it
if
it
was
n't
for
those
annoy
littl
kid
.
``
The
kid
''
in
this
film
are
the
three
Canadian
who
are
terribl
underus
make
their
relationship
with
Carter
underdevelop
and
unbeliev
.
The
lawyer
who
help
releas
Carter
also
are
underus
,
as
is
Clanci
Brown
as
a
kind
prison
guard
-LRB-
the
complet
opposit
of
his
charact
in
``
Shawshank
Redempt
''
-RRB-
.
There
is
a
great
amount
of
talent
in
this
support
cast
but
it
just
never
appear
.
Hedaya
was
superb
in
``
Clueless
,
''
same
for
David
Paymer
in
``
Get
Shorti
,
''
Harri
yulin
in
``
Ghostbust
''
and
Liev
Schreiber
in
``
The
Daytripp
.
''
It
is
a
mysteri
how
this
mani
actor
sign
on
to
such
shallow
role
.
On
the
other
hand
,
it
is
absolut
no
mysteri
whi
Denzel
Washington
agre
to
play
Rubin
``
Hurrican
''
Carter
.
This
role
is
about
as
far
off
from
shallow
as
you
can
get
.
