All

all
,
``

is
a
snappi
ride
,
although
there
are
a
coupl

point
I
found

But

ogr

yard
into
an
Ellis

charact
when
he

As
a
result
,
Shrek
find
himself
surround
by
legend
like
the
Three
Blind
Mice
,
Pinocchio
,
the
Big
Bad
Wolf

and

to
name
but
a
few
.
An

``

-RRB-
Farquaad

-LRB-
Eddie

-RRB-
determin
to
make

green
grump

.
They
final
hook
up
with
the
princess
,
onli
to
learn
she
is
not
the
helpless
maiden
they
expect
to
meet
.
For
the
matter
,
the
dragon
offer
a
few
surpris
as
well
.
The
movi
refer
a
great
mani
other
flick
,
from
``
Babe
''
-LRB-
``
That
ll
do
,
donkey
.
''
That
ll
do
''
-RRB-
to
''
The
Graduat
.
''
''
But
the
lion
's
share
of
the
joke
come
at
the
expens
of
the
wonder
world
of
Disney
.
The
public-domain
charact
made
into
icon
in
various
Disney
film
take
their
hit
Pinocchio
is
refer
to
as
a
``
possess
toy
''
and
when
Shrek
spi
a
sleep
Snow
White
in
his
cabin
,
he
bellow
,
``
Get
that
dead
broad
off
the
tabl
!
''
but
the
biggest
slam
come
when
Shrek
visit
Farquaad
's
royal
domicil
,
which
close
resembl
a
certain
magic
kingdom
,
from
it
souvenir
stand
and
queue
line
to
a
display
of
animatron
figur
that
sing
the
palac
rule
in
a
relentless
peppi
tune
that
sound
a
lot
like
``
It
's
a
Small
World
.
''
Which
bring
me
to
disturb
point
number
one
.
I
laugh
at
all
the
Disney
swipe
,
but
found
the
mental
behind
them
a
bit
sad
.
The
acrimoni
between
Dreamwork
honcho
Jeff
Katzenberg
and
Disney
big
wheel
Michael
Eisner
is
well
known
.
For
year
the
two
compani
have
tri
to
sabotag
each
other
's
film
and
video
releas
by
issu
similar
compet
product
on
the
same
day
.
And
now
we
have
Katzenberg
use
an
entir
movi
to
attack
his
former
employ
.
Here
's
a
suggest
for
the
two
boy
:
Grow
up
!
Put
the
past
behind
you
!
There
's
room
in
the
sandbox
for
both
of
you
and
if
you
farquaad
ca
n't
play
nice
,
then
go
to
your
room
!
The
other
area
I
found
troubl
came
in
the
portray
of
Lord
Farquaad
.
Beyond
all
the
irrever
,
``
Shrek
''
actual
has
a
messag
:
Peopl
should
learn
to
look
beyond
physic
appear
,
becaus
true
beauti
lie
within
.
It
's
a
love
notion
,
but
the
film
betray
it
own
moral
by
incess
take
cheap
shot
at
Farquaad
's
diminut
statur
.
Do
we
realli
need
a
famili
film
reinforc
the
idea
that
mock
short
peopl
is
accept
?
The
pompous
,
selfish
behavior
of
Farquaad
is
enough
to
make
him
a
target
for
zinger
.
Adding
short
joke
is
simpli
mean
.
Still
,
``
Shrek
''
is
a
rollick
good
time
.
The
comput
anim
is
most
impress
-LRB-
although
sever
key
charact
look
like
anim
rubber
squeez
toy
and
the
human
movement
are
often
jerki
-RRB-
,
the
voic
work
is
strong
-LRB-
particular
from
Eddie
Murphi
-RRB-
,
the
laugh
come
fast
and
furious
,
and
the
moral
,
taint
though
it
may
be
,
is
a
good
one
.
To
trot
out
a
clich
,
``
Shrek
''
is
fun
for
all
age
.
Parent
,
though
,
should
remind
their
young
one
dure
the
ride
home
that
taunt
other
becaus
they
are
short
,
tall
,
skinni
,
fat
,
etc.
is
a
bad
thing
.
