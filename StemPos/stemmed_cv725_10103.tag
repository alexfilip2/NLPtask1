He

Citi

live
with
her
new

-LRB-
Tchéki

a
complet
surpris

But
as
we
all
know
love
is
blind
and
so
Sam
leav
for
New
york
as
well
to
win
her
back
.
He
move
into
an
abandon
hous
across
the
street
from
Anton
's
apart
and
instal
a
camera
obscura
to
watch
them
.
Sudden
Anton
's
ex
Maggi
show
up
,
but
she
doe
not
want
her
former
lover
back
.
On
the
contrari
,
all
she
want
to
do
is
vapor
him
.
She
may
say
that
she
doe
n't
want
to
kill
him
,
but
the
possibl
doe
n't
bother
her
too
much
either
.
After
all
,
peopl
die
everi
day
.
In
spite
of
their
differ
motiv
the
two
team
up
and
fall
for
each
other
as
thing
move
on
.
The
stori
sound
like
someth
we
all
have
seen
a
million
time
.
But
we
have
n't
.
Griffin
Dunn
bring
us
the
most
charm
comedi
sinc
``
While
you
where
sleep
''
.
The
camera
obscura
add
a
``
special
someth
''
to
the
movi
and
make
it
an
except
romant
comedi
.
Everyth
about
the
movi
is
perfect
,
from
set
design
to
cast
.
The
dialogu
are
inspir
and
the
touch
of
black
humor
add
a
certain
bite
.
Meg
Ryan
,
known
from
``
When
Harri
met
Salli
''
or
``
Sleepless
in
Seattl
''
,
surpris
in
a
role
that
may
final
help
her
get
rid
of
her
sweet
littl
girl
imag
.
She
impress
the
viewer
as
a
maneat
biker
girl
.
Even
more
surpris
is
the
fact
that
the
viewer
believ
her
,
much
more
so
than
in
last
year
``
Courag
under
Fire
''
where
she
play
a
Gulf
war
pilot
.
Matthew
Broderick
is
the
goodnatur
and
somewhat
naiv
Sam
who
has
troubl
accept
realiti
.
The
viewer
can
tell
that
he
doe
n't
onli
watch
the
star
but
also
tri
to
reach
out
for
them
.
He
has
troubl
keep
in
touch
with
realiti
.
After
all
,
who
would
leav
everyth
behind
to
chase
a
lost
love
?
His
naiveté
that
we
do
n't
question
for
a
minut
throughout
the
movi
clash
with
Maggi
exagger
wish
for
reveng
.
She
would
do
anyth
to
harm
Anton
.
She
doe
n't
hesit
to
use
Sam
for
her
plan
and
make
him
understand
right
from
the
begin
that
noth
will
happen
between
the
two
of
them
.
That
make
the
scene
when
they
innoc
share
a
bed
,
have
potato
chip
and
watch
the
action
across
the
street
like
a
saturday
night
show
on
TV
even
funnier
.
Tchéki
Karyo
is
perfect
as
Anton
.
He
is
,
well
,
repuls
.
That
's
all
there
is
to
say
about
him
.
you
ca
n't
realli
manag
to
piti
him
,
even
after
all
his
mishap
.
He
not
onli
took
Sam
's
bride
away
from
him
,
he
is
also
a
French
chef
.
World
collid
,
i.
e.
the
USA
and
Franc
.
This
can
onli
go
wrong
.
Even
if
Maggi
reveng
scheme
are
at
time
shock
,
you
just
ca
n't
sympath
with
a
man
who
play
``
Je
t
`
aim
...
moi
non
plus
''
on
his
tape
deck
.
Not
everyon
is
captur
by
the
French
charm
that
Linda
and
even
Maggi
fell
for
.
Sam
certain
is
n't
.
Too
bad
for
Anton
.
For
him
thing
take
a
turn
to
the
wors
.
``
Addict
to
Love
''
is
one
of
this
year
's
most
pleasant
surpris
.
