I
think
that
say
that
The
X-File
is
one
of
this
summer
's
most
anticip
film
is
safe
.
For
five
year
,
``
The
X-File
''
televis
show
has
develop
a
dedic
fan
cultur
,
whose
rabid
devot
to
the
seri
rival
that
of
``
Star
Trek
''
fan
.
The
premis
of
both
the
movi
and
the
televis
seri
is
two
FBI
agent
who
investig
the
paranorm
;
Fox
Mulder
-LRB-
David
Duchovni
-RRB-
is
the
avid
believ
whose
quest
to
find
the
truth
about
extraterrestri
life
border
on
the
paranoid
,
and
Dana
Sculli
-LRB-
Gillian
Anderson
-RRB-
is
the
scientif
skeptic
tri
to
find
a
ration
explan
to
Mulder
's
flight
of
fanci
.
Outlin
the
plot
of
The
X-File
movi
is
virtual
imposs
,
sinc
to
be
general
would
result
in
confus
,
yet
to
be
specif
would
give
too
much
away
.
Nevertheless
,
I
will
tri
.
``
The
black
ooz
,
''
and
extraterrestri
,
virus-lik
substanc
is
threaten
Earth
.
A
``
shadow
govern
''
is
awar
of
this
,
but
tri
to
cover-up
the
alien
exist
.
Mulder
and
Sculli
know
``
the
truth
is
out
there
,
''
and
so
tri
to
expos
both
the
invas
and
the
cover-up
.
There
are
three
central
question
I
have
heard
ask
about
this
movi
:
1
.
Will
those
who
do
n't
watch
the
seri
be
abl
to
understand
the
movi
?
yes
.
Isolat
as
an
individu
text
,
The
X-File
can
stand
alon
.
They
have
given
enough
background
for
anyon
,
familiar
with
the
show
or
not
,
to
understand
the
movi
.
Although
some
of
the
secondari
charact
'
histori
may
confus
the
uniniti
,
those
charact
are
not
essenti
to
the
film
.
This
is
a
major
problem
:
they
trot
out
token
secondari
charact
from
the
seri
out
for
an
appear
and
then
disappear
just
as
quick
.
Whi
bring
Superintend
Skinner
into
the
pictur
in
the
first
place
,
and
then
have
him
sat
silent
on
an
FBI
intern
affair
committe
?
Whi
bring
in
``
The
Lone
Gunmen
,
''
three
comput
geek
conspiraci
theorist
,
for
an
even
briefer
appear
?
These
charact
are
recurr
on
the
seri
,
and
their
appear
in
the
film
was
met
with
whoop
from
the
audienc
-LRB-
suggest
their
popular
among
fans-actu
most
of
the
audienc
could
pass
for
``
the
Lone
Gunmen
''
-RRB-
.
Still
,
then
they
vanish
just
as
quick
.
2
.
The
televis
show
never
give
us
ani
answer
.
Will
the
movi
actual
explain
some
thing
?
yes
.
In
The
X-File
we
get
a
fair
complet
histori
of
``
the
black
ooz
,
''
what
it
is
and
what
it
want
.
We
final
get
some
understand
of
the
motiv
behind
the
``
shadow
govern
.
''
There
are
even
some
subtl
tie-in
with
contemporari
UFO-olog
,
includ
the
``
grey
''
and
the
Roswel
Crash
of
1947
.
3
.
Is
the
movi
ani
good
?
No
.
The
X-File
is
a
dread
movi
and
show
some
fundament
problem
with
writer/cr
Chris
Carter
's
talent
and
the
relationship
between
cinema
and
televis
.
First
off
,
the
screenplay
by
seri
creator
Chris
Carter
is
sloppi
and
clich
.
After
approxim
forty-f
minut
-LRB-
the
length
of
a
televis
episod
minus
the
commerci
-RRB-
,
the
pace
drop
to
a
snail
's
crawl
.
Not
long
after
that
point
,
when
Carter
attempt
to
answer
some
question
we
have
had
about
the
seri
,
we
wish
he
had
not
.
The
explan
are
so
trite
and
ridicul
that
one
would
have
prefer
it
had
Carter
not
explain
quit
so
much
.
I
am
will
to
suspend
my
disbelief
a
fair
bit
,
but
the
absurd
Carter
want
me
to
swallow
was
just
too
much
.
Break
the
suspens
of
disbelief
destroy
the
movie-and
listen
to
other
fan
leav
the
cinema
,
mayb
the
seri
too
.
The
explan
are
not
onli
absurd
,
they
are
tire
and
unorigin
.
The
extraterrestri
breed
and
gestat
like
those
from
the
Alien
seri
,
and
their
craft
look
like
a
leftov
set
piec
from
Independ
Day
.
Note
that
the
Alien
movi
,
ID4
,
and
The
X-File
are
all
from
20thCenturi
Fox-a
studio
that
is
begin
to
cannib
itself
I
think
.
The
X-File
is
noteworthi
for
be
the
onli
movi
base
on
a
televis
seri
to
be
produc
while
the
seri
was
still
run
.
In
compar
the
movi
and
televis
seri
certain
aspect
of
the
respect
media
emerg
.
The
avoid
of
the
seri
to
answer
the
question
it
rais
annoy
and
frustrat
mani
peopl
.
Howev
,
I
rather
like
that
about
the
seri
.
Televis
allow
you
to
impos
as
much
,
or
as
littl
,
mean
on
a
show
as
you
want
.
It
is
the
proverbi
``
blank
screen
''
which
we
project
our
mind
on
.
Mean
on
televis
is
open
and
ambigu
;
it
is
the
natur
of
the
medium
.
Cinema
,
on
the
other
hand
,
is
the
opposit
.
It
project
onto
us
the
filmmak
mind
.
We
can
,
in
some
film
,
fill
the
textual
gap
ourselv
,
but
that
almost
never
happen
in
an
American
film
.
Mean
,
in
cinema
,
need
to
be
self-contain
and
determin
.
So
,
when
The
X-File
made
that
jump
from
small
to
big
screen
,
Carter
need
to
take
into
consider
the
differ
in
the
medium
as
well
.
He
did
not
.
By
make
explicit
,
what
the
televis
show
left
implicit
,
Carter
reveal
the
limit
of
his
creativ
and
skill
.
When
they
say
that
``
fan
''
make
a
TV
show
,
it
is
not
far
from
the
truth
.
On
televis
,
fan
cultur
must
impos
it
mean
on
the
text
becaus
there
is
noth
there
.
How
true
that
is
when
we
see
the
``
explicit
''
X-Files-ther
is
noth
there
.
