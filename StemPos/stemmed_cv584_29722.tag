Jamaica
is
a
hot
vacat
spot
.
The

of
wealth
-LRB-
approxim
30
Jamaican
dollar
to
one
American
-RRB-
,
the
sea
is
a
brilliant
blue
,
the
air
is
warm
but
lack
humid
.
And
as
tourism
is
unfortun
Jamaica
's
biggest
trade
,
foreign
enter
and
leav
with
a
sens
of
relax
.
Life
and
Debt
take
a
brassi
look
at
life
insid
this
impoverish
countri
.
While
normal
documentari
take
the
Salli
Struther
approach
of
under
scene
of
starv
children
with
tear
music
,
this
film
guid
the
viewer
with
a
sarcast
voiceov
that
bring
the
troubl
home
without
beg
tear
to
the
surfac
.
The
voiceov
is
written
by
acclaim
author
Jamaica
Kincaid
.
It
guid
the
audienc
along
a
tourist
's
journey
and
the
stori
of
the
nativ
inhabit
.
Instead
of
tell
you
what
you
are
alreadi
see
on
screen
,
it
quip
,
``
you
do
n't
see
what
happen
after
you
flush
the
toilet
.
''
This
engag
a
viewer
to
see
and
think
about
devast
instead
of
mere
be
told
it
is
there
.
This
strong
,
spars
storytel
approach
run
throughout
the
film
.
Stephani
Black
is
also
intellig
in
how
she
choos
to
disclos
the
problem
face
by
the
local
.
This
is
n't
just
anoth
talk
head
show
of
peopl
moan
about
their
horribl
lot
in
life
.
Peopl
are
interview
from
all
sector
of
occup
,
from
field
to
factori
,
as
well
as
social
theorist
and
the
bank
organ
that
continu
to
invest
in
the
countri
.
The
varieti
of
discuss
perpetu
a
compel
intern
dialogu
with
ani
viewer
,
whether
they
are
see
Jamaica
for
the
first
time
or
not
.
Of
cours
,
as
can
be
expect
,
the
Unite
State
is
slam
,
owe
to
it
involv
with
the
Internat
Monetari
Fund
and
the
World
Bank
.
Official
look
moron
as
they
explain
whi
their
plan
for
Jamaica
's
economi
will
help
the
countri
back
on
it
feet
,
but
onli
if
they
are
will
to
follow
the
advic
word
for
word
.
The
next
moment
we
see
whi
and
how
each
of
these
initi
has
fail
,
usual
due
to
import
be
cheaper
than
local
labor
or
whether
or
not
the
soil
is
appropri
for
the
next
agricultur
trend
the
U.S.
is
forc
on
the
citizen
.
Admit
,
some
of
the
back
and
forth
between
the
business-mind
organ
and
the
failur
they
produc
get
repetit
,
but
it
also
drive
home
the
impact
ignor
can
have
on
both
side
of
an
intern
argument
.
But
Jamaica
is
n't
against
the
Unite
State
,
and
this
documentari
doe
not
accus
the
U.S.
of
be
the
sole
perpetr
of
it
grief
.
If
anyth
,
it
beg
for
a
better
understand
of
the
natur
of
Jamaican
societi
befor
step
in
to
chang
it
base
on
foreign
regul
