Krippendorf
's
Tribe
is
a
formula
comedi
.
Done
poor
,
formula
comedi
might
seem
to
signifi
the
downfal
of
American
cinema
.
Howev
,
everi
now
and
then
,
one
emerg
,
like
Krippendorf
's
Tribe
,
that
actual
work
.
Professor
Jame
Krippendorf
-LRB-
Richard
Dreyfuss
-RRB-
,
the
renown
anthropologist
,
is
in
troubl
.
His
univers
gave
him
a
hefti
grant
to
discov
a
lost
tribe
in
New
Guinea
.
Howev
,
he
found
...
noth
.
His
wife
has
recent
die
,
and
he
has
spent
the
remaind
of
the
grant
money
in
rais
his
three
kid
:
Shelli
-LRB-
Natasha
Lyonn
-RRB-
,
Mickey
-LRB-
Gregori
Smith
-RRB-
and
Edmund
-LRB-
Carl
Michael
Lidner
-RRB-
.
Tonight
,
he
is
expect
to
lectur
on
his
newfound
tribe
.
Rather
than
break
the
news
-LRB-
and
face
the
consequ
of
misus
his
fund
-RRB-
,
he
invent
a
tribe
:
the
Shelmikedmu
-LRB-
name
after
his
kid
-RRB-
.
Howev
,
one
lie
beget
anoth
as
he
is
not
onli
requir
to
deliv
film
proof
of
the
Shelmikedmu
,
but
his
research
becom
a
popular
phenomenon
.
Soon
,
Professor
Krippendorf
is
caught
up
in
an
elabor
ruse
in
which
he
film
mockumentari
footag
star
his
children
as
the
Shelmikedmu
tribal
member
.
His
effort
are
hamper
by
the
boast
of
an
over-eag
colleagu
,
Veronica
Micelli
-LRB-
Jenna
Elfman
-RRB-
,
and
the
intens
scrutini
of
a
rival
anthropologist
,
Ruth
Allen
-LRB-
Lili
Tomlin
-RRB-
.
Krippendorf
's
Tribe
doe
seem
to
requir
a
littl
suspens
of
disbelief
.
No
one
seem
to
question
the
way
his
field
documentari
seem
to
be
shot
with
multipl
camera
,
or
that
his
newli
discov
tribesmen
have
startl
blue
eye
.
Luckili
,
as
the
film
build
momentum
,
that
suspens
of
disbelief
is
easi
to
come
by
.
Though
there
's
some
mild
humor
in
the
Krippendorf
famili
tri
to
pass
themselv
off
as
a
lost
tribe
,
the
real
humor
of
the
film
is
in
how
Jame
get
trap
in
his
ever
increas
snowbal
of
lie
.
The
doubl
mean
to
mani
of
the
Shelmikedmu
appear
are
enjoy
,
and
the
comic
time
requir
for
some
of
the
film
's
latter
scene
is
superb
.
Richard
Dreyfuss
is
terrif
as
the
hapless
professor
who
soon
lose
control
of
his
own
imaginari
tribe
.
Jenna
Elfman
's
posit
as
a
romant
lead
seem
a
bit
forc
at
time
,
but
she
play
the
part
with
extrem
affabl
.
Even
the
kid
,
who
in
film
like
this
tend
to
be
a
bit
on
the
precoci
side
,
are
endear
and
humor
.
yes
,
the
film
doe
veer
occasion
into
some
rather
lowbrow
humor
,
but
it
has
the
best
excus
of
all
:
it
's
funni
.
It
may
not
go
down
as
an
all-tim
classic
,
but
it
certain
deliv
what
you
expect
from
a
comedi
:
plenti
of
laugh
.
