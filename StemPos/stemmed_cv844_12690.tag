Warren
Beatti
's
``
Bulworth
''
is
a
caustic
polit
comedi
that
doe
n't
attack
ani
particular
polit
group
,
but
rather
the
ingrain
insincer
that
has
infect
the
American
polit
system
.
Some
might
think
this
film
is
vulgar
,
and
in
mani
way
it
is
.
Howev
,
as
loud
and
raucous
as
it
is
,
``
Bulworth
''
speak
the
truth
,
which
is
almost
alway
ugli
to
hear
.
Beatti
,
who
direct
the
film
and
co-wrot
the
script
with
Jeremi
Pikser
-LRB-
``
The
Lemon
Sister
''
-RRB-
,
star
as
incumb
U.S.
Senat
Jay
Billington
Bulworth
,
who
has
one
of
the
best
politician
name
in
cinema
histori
.
Bulworth
is
a
Democrat
,
and
in
Beatti
's
view
,
he
is
symbol
of
everyth
that
has
gone
wrong
with
the
current
Democrat
Parti
.
Once
an
ideolog
liber
-LRB-
like
Beatti
still
is
-RRB-
,
Bulworth
has
long
sinc
succumb
to
the
materialist
pressur
of
Washington
.
Instead
of
wage
the
battl
for
the
impoverish
and
the
downtrodden
,
which
was
onc
the
call
card
of
Democrat
,
Bulworth
has
becom
anoth
sell-out
money
hound-if
he
's
not
accept
illeg
bribe
from
the
insur
lobbi
or
take
campaign
contribut
from
the
Chines
,
he
's
make
wind-bag
speech
that
start
with
the
amus
Clintonesq
statement
,
``
America
is
stand
on
the
doorstep
of
a
new
millennium
...
.
blah
,
blah
,
blah
.
''
When
the
film
open
,
it
is
a
few
day
befor
the
1996
primari
elect
,
and
Bulworth
is
sit
at
his
desk
weep
becaus
he
realiz
how
corrupt
he
has
becom
.
In
a
fit
of
desper
,
he
take
out
a
$
10
million
life
insur
polici
from
a
dirti
insur
rep
play
by
Paul
Sorvino
-LRB-
part
of
a
shadi
lobbi
deal
to
kill
a
threaten
bill
in
committe
-RRB-
,
and
then
hire
a
hit
man
to
kill
him
,
although
he
doe
n't
know
who
the
assassin
will
be
,
or
when
the
hit
will
take
place
.
Know
that
he
will
soon
be
dead
,
Bulworth
unleash
his
own
brand
of
polit
rhetor
on
the
world
,
which
is
made
up
of
polit
incorrect
truth
about
the
state
of
American
polit
and
the
societi
in
general
.
At
a
Compton
church
,
he
tell
the
group
of
African-American
that
they
will
have
no
power
in
the
U.S.
unless
they
``
put
down
that
malt
liquor
and
chicken
wing
,
and
get
behind
somebodi
other
than
a
run
back
who
stab
his
wife
.
''
Later
,
in
a
particular
hilari
sequenc
,
Bulworth
mix
with
the
Hollywood
elit
,
then
insult
the
qualiti
of
their
movi
and
inform
them
that
the
onli
reason
he
's
there
is
becaus
``
my
guy
alway
put
the
big
Jew
on
my
schedul
.
''
All
throughout
this
physic
and
polit
suicid
escapad
,
Bulworth
's
Chief
of
Staff
,
Denni
Murphi
-LRB-
Oliver
Platt
-RRB-
,
follow
behind
in
a
state
of
constant
shock
and
bewilder
.
Platt
has
some
of
the
movi
's
funniest
scene
,
as
he
make
Murphi
into
a
polit
savvi
but
nonetheless
clueless
assist
who
is
forc
to
watch
his
own
career
teeter
at
the
brink
of
be
flush
down
the
toilet
.
His
constant
half-truth-tel
and
spin-doctor
to
cover
Bulworth
's
stamped
is
equal
in
it
pervers
onli
by
a
self-right
report
-LRB-
Nora
Dunn
-RRB-
who
act
like
Murphi
's
refus
to
explain
Bulworth
's
action
-LRB-
someth
he
realli
can
not
do
-RRB-
is
somehow
an
act
of
treason
.
When
Bulworth
decid
he
want
to
live
after
all
,
and
therefor
must
constant
evad
a
grim-look
assassin
to
be
who
's
trail
him
at
everi
turn
,
he
hide
out
in
the
ghetto
,
complet
with
a
stereotyp
gangsta
wardrob
which
he
wear
to
one
of
his
televis
interview
.
At
this
point
,
Beatti
abandon
much
of
the
polit
aspect
and
dive
into
a
cartoonish
explor
of
the
black
inner-c
experi
.
Bulworth
becom
friend
with
a
young
black
woman
name
Nina
-LRB-
Hall
Berri
-RRB-
,
who
he
meet
at
the
Harlem
church
ralli
.
She
has
a
tough-talk
brother
who
is
deep
in
debt
to
a
local
gangster
name
L.D.
-LRB-
Don
Cheadl
of
``
Boogi
Night
''
-RRB-
,
who
also
becom
involv
in
Bulworth
's
campaign
.
Some
of
the
scene
in
the
ghetto
ring
true
,
but
much
of
it
feel
like
a
lighter
version
of
scene
depict
in
more
intens
inner-c
film
like
``
Boyz
N
Hood
''
-LRB-
1991
-RRB-
and
``
Menac
II
Societi
''
-LRB-
1993
-RRB-
.
``
Bulworth
's
''
chief
liabil
is
Beatti
's
insist
on
have
his
charact
adopt
a
clumsi
style
of
rap
as
his
new
communic
devic
.
Instead
of
speak
at
polit
ralli
,
he
break
into
a
kind
of
rhythmless
rap
style
that
is
a
remind
of
whi
almost
all
hip-hop
star
are
black
.
It
's
hard
to
tell
whether
Beatti
is
be
humor
by
be
so
bad
,
or
whether
he
's
actual
that
incompet
.
At
ani
rate
,
the
rap
sound
more
Run
D.M.C.
than
Snoop
Doggi
Dogg
,
which
make
the
film
seem
date
instead
of
contemporari
.
Beatti
would
have
been
better
off
simpli
adopt
some
of
the
inner-c
lingo
and
work
that
into
his
speech
,
instead
of
tri
to
sound
like
L.L.
Cool
J
.
Other
than
that
,
``
Bulworth
''
hit
all
it
target
with
wri
,
hilari
accuraci
.
The
film
is
like
a
letter
bomb
to
the
Democrat
Parti
,
and
even
if
you
do
n't
agre
with
Beatti
's
liber
messag
about
the
unrequit
duti
of
the
feder
govern
,
it
is
hard
to
deni
the
impact
the
film
has
in
explor
the
monetari
and
moral
debaucheri
that
infest
modern
polit
.
Unlike
``
Primari
Color
''
which
open
earlier
this
year
,
``
Bulworth
''
doe
n't
tri
to
tip-to
around
the
truli
pain
issu
that
hit
close
to
home-instead
,
it
take
them
dead-on
.
