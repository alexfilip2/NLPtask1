There
was
probabl
a
good
reason
that
the
Warner
Bros.
studio
chose
not
to
allow
critic
to
view
this
Steven
Seagal
film
when
it
first
open
.
And
,
after
see
this
piec
of
toxic
wast
,
I
now
know
whi
.
This
movi
is
by
far
the
worst
offer
that
has
hit
the
screen
sinc
possibl
those
Ernest
movi
year
ago
.
Fire
Down
Below
center
it
stori
on
a
littl
mine
town
in
God
's
countri
,
somewher
in
eastern
Kentucki
.
It
's
beauti
and
natur
good
is
be
slowli
destroy
by
an
uncar
mine
magnat
-LRB-
Kris
Kristopherson
,
who
constant
look
like
he
want
to
kill
his
agent
for
get
him
this
role
-RRB-
.
It
turn
out
that
he
's
fill
the
mine
throughout
Kentucki
with
toxic
wast
for
a
tidi
profit
.
Seagal
play
Jack
Taggert
,
an
aikido-vers
,
fight
machin
,
who
is
an
agent
with
the
EPA
.
No
...
not
the
CIA
nor
the
FBI
nor
the
NSA
.
It
's
the
Environment
Protect
Agenci
.
I
had
no
idea
that
EPA
agent
were
train
to
be
killer
!
Taggert
is
sent
to
find
the
perpetr
and
to
bring
them
to
justic
.
Written
by
someon
name
Jeb
,
I
could
alreadi
envis
the
stereotyp
of
incestu
relationship
,
banjo-pick
preacher
,
and
dumb-as-nail
redneck
.
But
the
script
put
Seagal
right
smack
dab
in
the
middl
of
all
of
these
scenario
as
he
tri
to
discreet
fit
in
.
Seagal
's
idea
of
a
disguis
is
a
long-length
$
1000
leather
jacket
.
But
to
get
closer
to
the
kinfolk
,
he
will
fix
peopl
's
porch
for
free
.
That
's
anoth
great
EPA
asset-teach
agent
how
to
fix
porch
.
Slow
and
plod
,
this
project
is
a
total
mess
.
The
sometim
allur
of
watch
Seagal
is
watch
him
outmaneuv
enemi
that
outnumb
and
outgun
him
like
in
Under
Seig
.
Here
,
his
bravado
basic
turn
into
bully
.
Townsfolk
who
are
foolish
enough
to
challeng
Seagal
are
quick
subdu
.
Fight
scene
are
quick
and
senseless
and
offer
no
enjoy
valu
whatsoev
.
And
his
soap
box
messag
wear
thin
within
the
firstminut
.
The
most
annoy
moment
come
when
he
barg
into
the
middl
of
a
Sunday
church
ceremoni
,
get
behind
the
pulpit
,
and
beseech
the
townsfolk
to
take
control
of
their
live
and
to
help
clean
up
the
environ
.
But
the
epitom
of
how
moralist
mushi
this
film
get
happen
when
the
person
respons
for
the
toxic
dump
,
Kristopherson
,
meet
up
with
Seagal
.
Kristopherson
ask
Seagal
how
much
it
will
take
for
him
to
go
away
.
Seagal
gallant
repli
:
``
I
ll
leav
when
you
take
the
poison
from
the
stream
and
the
earth
.
''
I
was
expect
patriot
music
to
start
blast
and
a
show
of
firework
in
the
background
.
This
is
truli
noth
more
than
a
pompous
showcas
for
Seagal
's
righteous
and
narcissist
arrog
.
Seagal
has
been
vanguard
in
tri
to
bring
a
new
genr
into
the
filmplac
,
that
of
the
enviro-thril
-LRB-
On
Dead
Ground
-RRB-
.
Howev
,
the
messag
will
never
come
across
through
poor
develop
vehicl
like
this
.
Still
,
I
believ
in
preserv
Mother
Earth
,
so
save
your
$
5
and
pleas
donat
it
instead
to
some
worthi
environment
conscious
chariti
.
