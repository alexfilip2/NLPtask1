,
the

Also
,
there
are
quit
a
number
of
real
news
footag
which
were
broadcast
dure
the
accid
which
took
the
entir
US
nation
into
5
day

.
The
special
effect
by
Digit

are
up
to
standard
and
the
music
suit
the
suspens
and
drama
veri
well
,
thank
to
film-mus
maestro
Jame

.
Watch
out
for
the
launch
sequenc
,
it
is
simpli
one
of
the
most
breathtak
scene
of
the
film
.
A
bad
point
though
:
APOLLO
13
featur
much
technic
jargon
and
mani
physic
concept
in
it
script
.
Those
who
consid
themselv
`
scientif
illiter
'
might
have
a
slight
problem
understand
what
caus
this
and
what
caus
that
dure
the
cours
of
the
show
.
This
is
howev
,
just
a
minor
point
,
just
forget
all
those
technic
bullshit
and
immers
yourselv
into
the
drama
and
suspens
throughout
the
film
.
you
should
enjoy
it
.
