``
Paulin
at
the
Beach
,
''
is
one
of
those
small
,
deliber
pace
,
but
charm
foreign
film
in
which
not
much
happen
plot
wise
,
but
a
lot
happen
to
the
charact
emot
.
The
film
take
place
dure
a
few
week
of
August
at
the
Normandi
Coast
,
and
center
on
six
differ
charact
,
primarili
Paulin
-LRB-
Amanda
Langlet
-RRB-
,
a
wise
beyond
her
year
15-year-old
who
has
come
to
stay
for
the
summer
with
her
older
cousin
,
Marion
-LRB-
Ariell
Dombasl
-RRB-
.
On
the
first
day
at
the
beach
,
Marion
run
into
an
old
high
school
flame
-LRB-
Fedoor
Atkine
-RRB-
,
and
although
he
want
to
rekindl
their
relationship
,
she
is
more
interest
in
an
older
,
more
seduct
woman

``
Paulin
at
the
Beach
,
''
is
not
a
film
in
which
big
dramat
thing
occur
,
and
there
is
not
a
clear-cut
,
tidi
conclus
to
the
stori
.
Instead
,
it
is
a
pictur
that
simpli
observ
it
charact
in
everi
day
life
,
and
the
surpris
come
from
littl
charact
detail
.
The
film
is
quit
talki
and
slow
move
,
and
so
it
is
pretti
safe
to
say
it
is
n't
for
those
who
are
onli
a
fan
of
action
movi
,
but
is
a
treat
for
those
viewer
who
often
like
to
ventur
outsid
of
the
big-budget
genr
and
see
a
good
art
film
.
This
is
the
first
film
by
acclaim
director
Eric
Rohmer
-LRB-
1969
's
``
My
Night
at
Maud
,
''
and
1971
's
``
Clair
's
Knee
''
-RRB-
that
I
have
seen
,
but
his
direct
is
assur
and
intellig
,
as
is
the
screenplay
,
which
he
also
wrote
.
``
Paulin
at
the
Beach
,
''
is
a
film
worth
see
.
