This
is
director
Tim
Burton
's
finest
film
to
date
.
Mani
will
compar
this
tale
of
Martian
who
invad
Earth
to
Independ
Day
,
but
even
though
the
stori
are
similar
,
they
realli
are
two
distinct
differ
film
.
Howev
as
a
whole
,
Mar
Attack
is
much
more
entertain
than
ID4
,
and
I
love
ID4
.
you
realli
have
to
be
in
the
right
frame
of
mind
to
enjoy
this
film
.
It
is
complet
wacked-out
and
unlik
anyth
you
ve
ever
seen
.
Once
the
silli
tone
of
the
film
is
set
,
it
's
easi
to
just
sit
back
and
throw
logic
out
the
window
becaus
logic
and
comedi
just
do
n't
mix
.
The
plot
is
simpl
:
Martian
invad
the
Earth
.
But
it
's
differ
than
ani
other
invas
film
.
Usualli
it
's
the
evil
alien
versus
the
heroic
human
.
This
time
howev
,
it
's
the
goofi
alien
versus
the
equal
goofi
human
.
The
Martian
,
who
are
all
comput
generat
,
are
just
about
the
funniest
thing
I
ve
seen
in
a
long
time
.
They
look
funni
,
they
move
funni
,
and
their
``
languag
''
is
hilari
.
And
about
the
special
effect
.
The
effect
in
Mar
Attack
!
are
just
about
the
most
flawless
one
I
ve
seen
to
date
.
The
comput
anim
of
the
martian
combin
with
the
goofi
person
they
are
given
make
them
seem
100
%
real
.
There
are
just
a
coupl
of
scene
that
do
n't
work
,
main
those
involv
Sarah
Jessica
Parker
and
Pierc
Brosnan
on
board
an
alien
ship
.
Also
,
Glenn
Close
overact
tremend
in
her
-LRB-
thank
-RRB-
veri
limit
screen
time
,
so
much
so
that
I
actual
applaud
silent
when
her
charact
meet
her
demis
.
But
there
are
mani
big
laugh
in
the
film
,
as
I
said
,
if
you
are
in
the
right
mood
.
Could
it
have
been
funnier
?
Certain
.
Was
it
funni
enough
?
yes
.
Was
I
entertain
?
Absolut
.
On
a
person
note
,
I
'd
like
to
thank
whomev
cast
Rod
Steiger
-LRB-
my
favorit
actor
-RRB-
in
the
film
as
war-crazi
Gener
Decker
.
Final
,
after
mani
veri
small
part
in
direct
to
video
garbag
and
minor
TV
role
,
Steiger
is
back
on
the
big
screen
in
a
real
movi
that
mani
peopl
will
see
.
While
he
's
not
given
the
type
of
role
that
you
can
give
a
real
``
perform
''
in
,
he
doe
the
job
well
and
has
some
good
line
of
dialogu
.
The
preview
audienc
I
saw
the
film
with
realli
seem
to
enjoy
him
.
