Certain
thing
in
our
live
are
inevit
.
Death
,
sorrow
,
love
,
heartbreak
,
pain
,
joy
.
We
expect
these
event
.
We
know
they
re
go
to
happen
and
some
,
we
even
look
forward
to
.
It
's
part
of
the
human
condit
.
We
have
also
becom
accustom
to
inevit
occurr
in
our
societi
.
As
we
near
the
fall
elect
,
sever
of
them
are
hit
us
in
the
face
.
Politician
exagger
their
own
import
.
Our
side
is
alway
right
;
their
is
alway
wrong
.
In
the
end
,
voter
are
usual
forc
to
choos
the
lesser
of
two
whocar
.
In
Hollywood
the
one
indisput
inevit
is
that
if
a
film
make
big
money
,
there
will
be
a
sequel
.
Even
if
the
origin
stori
doe
n't
merit
one
.
Even
if
the
first
film
is
complet
in
itself
.
Even
if
success
is
a
fluke
.
``
The
Blair
Witch
Project
''
was
made
with
a
budget
of
$
1.75
and
explod
on
the
screen
,
rake
in
huge
profit
.
The
concept
was
brilliant
.
The
filmmak
creat
a
remark
buzz
that
the
stori
might
be
real
.
The
film
itself
was
even
more
convinc
.
The
movi
_
must
_
be
authent
.
Whi
els
would
such
amateurish
footag
be
on
the
big
screen
?
The
first
film
caught
lightn
in
a
bottl
.
The
sequel
prove
you
ca
n't
pour
that
old
lightn
into
a
new
bottl
.
you
have
to
give
this
effort
some
credit
.
It
would
have
been
easi
to
have
made
the
same
movi
again
with
a
new
group
of
kid
.
It
would
have
been
easi
,
but
of
cours
,
it
would
n't
have
work
.
Instead
``
Book
Of
Shadow
''
acknowledg
the
first
film
as
a
movi
and
concentr
on
the
hysteria
follow
it
releas
.
It
's
a
great
scheme
and
possibl
the
onli
entertain
way
to
do
a
sequel
.
Unfortun
it
doe
n't
work
either
.
Five
kid
spend
the
night
in
the
wood
at
the
scene
of
the
first
film
.
Weird
stuff
happen
and
they
retreat
to
an
old
factori
where
one
of
them
live
.
Even
weirder
stuff
happen
.
Some
peopl
die
,
there
's
blood
and
knive
and
none
of
the
charact
have
a
lick
of
common
sens
.
While
suppos
do
serious
research
,
the
group
set
up
a
circl
of
surveil
camera
in
the
ruin
of
the
old
hous
in
the
wood
and
vow
to
stay
alert
all
night
await
a
visit
.
Then
they
proceed
to
get
total
trash
on
drug
and
alcohol
and
parti
down
with
veri
loud
,
veri
obnoxi
heavi
metal
music
.
It
's
a
bad
plan
.
The
cast
show
some
earli
promis
.
A
coupl
is
do
research
on
a
``
Blair
Witch
''
book
.
The
tour
guid
is
a
former
mental
patient
turn
ebay
aficionado
.
A
Goth
amazon
princess
add
a
bit
of
comed
relief
.
The
obligatori
hot
babe
is
the
2000
spiritu
cinemat
descend
of
the
cute
hippi
chick
,
the
cute
rock
and
roll
chick
and
the
cute
disco
chick
:
the
cute
Wiccan
chick
.
The
first
film
's
unaccomplish
actor
came
across
as
real
peopl
in
a
real
situat
becaus
hour
and
hour
of
video
were
shot
dure
day
in
the
wood
.
This
time
,
these
unaccomplish
actor
just
come
across
as
unaccomplish
actor
.
There
's
not
one
charact
you
care
about
when
they
start
shout
for
no
reason
.
Although
what
pass
for
a
plot
start
out
with
a
solid
idea
,
it
's
ruin
by
poor
execut
.
The
follow-up
to
one
of
the
most
success
horror
film
ever
is
noth
more
than
a
bad
slasher
movi
.
They
re
trap
in
an
old
big
weird
hous
.
They
stupid
separ
into
various
room
.
There
are
strang
nois
,
they
see
scari
apparit
and
peopl
disappear
.
Ever
see
this
movi
?
Season
documentari
director
Joe
Berling
should
know
better
.
The
film
featur
most
cheap
trick
and
unnecessari
gore
.
For
a
storylin
fill
with
surpris
,
it
's
odd
predic
.
``
The
Blair
Witch
Project
''
was
a
rare
triumph
of
style
over
substanc
.
``
The
Book
Of
Shadow
''
is
a
triumph
of
tedium
over
promis
.
