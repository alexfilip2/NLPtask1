I
never
understood
what
the
clich
``
Hell
on
Earth
''
truli
meant
until
veri
recent
.
I
ve
just
never
experienc
anyth
in
my
life
which
was
so
terrifi
,
so
horribl
,
so
monstrous
deplor
that
it
justifi
be
term
as
``
Hell
on
Earth
''
.
After
all
,
I
ve
never
been
to
war
,
I
ve
never
been
the
victim
of
ani
violent
crime
,
I
ve
never
realli
been
broken
heart
,
and
I
ve
never
been
audit
;
so
I
realli
had
no
frame
of
refer
as
to
peopl
meant
when
they
said
that
someth
was
``
Hell
on
Earth
''
In
a
perfect
world
,
I
would
be
in
charg
of
all
the
movi
studio
.
The
veri
first
thing
I
'd
do
in
this
perfect
world
,
would
be
to
take
everi
Hollywood
produc
who
think
that
set
ani
stori
in
contemporari
America
with
a
20-someth
cast
play
teenag
and
featur
a
soundtrack
rip
direct
from
MTV
,
and
throw
them
in
jail
.
But
it
would
n't
just
be
your
averag
jail
,
not
even
a
maximum
secur
instal
.
I
'd
have
these
produc
-LRB-
and
everyon
els
involv
in
the
product
of
these
film
-RRB-
put
in
front
of
a
war
crime
tribun
and
forc
to
beg
for
merci
for
their
crime
against
human
.
Now
you
re
probabl
think
to
yourself
:
``
Is
this
realli
how
bad
Cruel
Intention
is
?
''
The
answer
is
no
.
It
's
actual
much
wors
.
Watch
the
cast
of
this
motion
pictur
atroc
tri
to
act
their
way
through
Roger
Kumbl
's
aw
written
script
is
probabl
a
lot
like
stab
yourself
in
the
arm
with
a
chainsaw
and
then
pour
salt
on
the
open
wound
.
And
then
pour
acid
on
the
salt
.
I
do
n't
know
if
Kumbl
was
tri
to
evok
comedi
or
tragedi
out
of
his
open
scene
where
Marci
Greenbaum
-LRB-
Tara
Reid
-RRB-
whine
about
have
nude
photo
of
her
post
on
the
internet
,
but
the
onli
emot
I
felt
was
sheer
boredom
.
From
that
open
scene
,
where
bore
actor
Ryan
Phillipp
tri
to
seduc
TV
actress
Swoosi
Kurtz
,
to
the
conclus
which
I
do
n't
rememb
becaus
I
had
practic
fallen
asleep
;
Cruel
Intention
is
truli
``
Hell
on
Earth
,
''
right
up
there
with
war
and
tax
audit
.
