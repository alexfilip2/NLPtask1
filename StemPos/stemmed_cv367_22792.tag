Of
The
Affair
''

a
dark
and
moodi
romant
period
piec
,
that
Neil
Jordan
exquisit
write
and
direct

Although
it

sometim
confus
to

it
still
manag
to

Base
on
Graham

Sarah
find
Henri
to
be
a
bore
,
becaus
well
,
he
's
just

It
's
all
work
and
no
play
with
him
.
While
Mauric

Unfortun

It

While

sound
straight

it

not
.
It

the
two
men
,
unhappi
,
and
the
ever
last
love
.
All
this
may
sound
like
a
drag
,
but
it
realli
captur
your
interest
.
With
great
perform
by
Ralph
Fienn
-LRB-
do
anoth
English
Patient
type
of
film
,
onli
this
movi
is
better
-RRB-
and
Julianna
Moor
who
definit
deserv
an
Oscar
becaus
out
of
allfilm
she
did
in
1999
,
I
believ
this
was
the
role
,
she
had
the
most
passion
for
,
and
you
can
see
whi
.
The
stori
was
also
well
written
thank
to
Neil
Jordan
.
Even
though
I
did
n't
read
the
book
,
there
's
no
doubt
in
mind
that
it
was
just
as
move
and
descript
.
What
's
so
move
about
it
you
ask
?
The
tragedi
of
it
all
.
It
's
not
the
typic
romanc
,
in
which
a
guy
find
a
girl
,
they
fall
in
love
and
all
is
well
,
this
is
more
complic
and
depress
.
It
realli
show
the
complex
of
a
relationship
,
becaus
noth
is
ever
perfect
.
Everyon
feel
a
differ
way
and
that
is
what
tear
us
to
piec
.
Back
to
Neil
Jordan
's
script
,
it
was
n't
onli
red
rose
.
There
were
time
when
I
felt
it
too
be
a
littl
slow
,
but
most
Romanc
are
.
It
also
tend
to
be
a
bit
confus
,
especi
at
the
start
.
It
keep
jump
around
from
past
to
present
,
so
it
obvious
took
awhil
to
get
a
grasp
of
thing
.
Also
a
notabl
was
the
superb
direct
by
Neil
Jordan
.
I
'd
have
to
say
this
is
his
finest
achiev
to
date
,
becaus
quit
frank
I
ve
never
realli
found
his
work
to
be
up
to
par
.
It
just
never
did
anyth
for
me
,
until
now
.
When
it
end
,
it
leav
viewer
a
littl
sadden
,
but
provok
nonetheless
.
This
is
definit
one
of
the
best
film
of
99
,
and
had
some
of
the
best
act
,
most
notabl
by
Moor
.
Not
for
all
movi
goer
,
but
for
those
who
are
film
buff
and
want
someth
of
valu
.
