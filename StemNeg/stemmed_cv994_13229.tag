Movi
like
Six
Day
,
Seven
Night
make
me
mad
becaus
talent
peopl
like
Harrison
Ford
,
Anne
Hech
,
and
Ivan
Reitman
put
a
lot
of
hard
work
in
to
a
script
worth
about
ten
cent
.
The
script
was
written
by
Michael
Brown
,
and
he
decid
that
,
instead
of
think
up
new
idea
,
he
'd
rehash
a
lot
of
clich
,
omit
even
the
slightest
bit
of
charact
develop
,
and
then
throw
in
drug-deal
pirat
to
provid
for
a
few
high-level
action
sequenc
and
explos
.
There
are
good
script
out
there
that
high-profil
actor
can
make
-LRB-
see
The
Truman
Show
,
for
instanc
-RRB-
.
Six
Day
,
Seven
Night
is
simpli
a
wast
.
Let
's
see
...
we
have
to
get
Harrison
Ford
and
Anne
Hech
alon
on
an
island
.
So
,
how
do
we
do
that
?
Well
,
we
ll
make
her
a
feisti
magazin
editor
,
and
we
ll
make
him
a
crusti
old
pilot
.
But
wait
,
she
has
to
have
a
fianc
;
that
can
be
David
Schwimmer
.
But
wait
,
if
she
has
a
fianc
,
how
will
she
and
Harrison
Ford
crash
on
the
island
alon
?
I
know
!
They
ll
get
to
their
vacat
spot
,
and
then
she
ll
get
call
back
!
yessssss
!
So
,
they
ll
crash
on
the
island
,
and
that
will
be
funni
for
about
five
minut
.
Shuck
.
Oh
,
I
ve
got
it
!
We
ll
throw
in
a
distract
subplot
in
which
her
fianc
has
sex
with
a
realli
attract
woman
who
act
like
a
bimbo
,
and
then
he
can
feel
guilti
.
Then
,
when
Anne
Hech
kiss
Harrison
Ford
-LRB-
they
have
to
kiss
,
becaus
otherwis
nobodi
will
want
to
see
the
movi
-RRB-
,
it
will
be
a
vindic
action
,
becaus
her
fianc
will
alreadi
have
cheat
on
her
!
Then
,
for
no
obvious
reason
,
they
ll
accident
run
into
pirat
who
tri
to
kill
them
.
Oh
,
yes
!
I
feel
so
good
about
this
stori
.
Instead
of
use
character
to
propel
the
event
,
it
will
be
complet
random
,
and
yet
total
predict
!
Imagin
that
.
Do
n't
get
me
wrong
--
Six
Day
,
Seven
Night
is
not
a
bore
pictur
;
Ford
and
Hech
both
do
a
great
job
.
The
spark
fli
between
them
,
and
so
most
of
Brown
's
inan
dialogu
is
drown
out
by
the
actor
'
sheer
forc
of
talent
.
Almost
everi
scene
between
them
has
energi
that
the
perform
bring
to
the
screen
,
and
I
found
myself
laugh
pretti
hard
.
Schwimmer
is
also
funni
,
and
manag
to
milk
all
of
his
scene
for
whatev
he
can
get
.
And
Reitman
,
who
has
made
some
good
film
,
at
least
tri
to
make
thing
excit
.
Even
though
the
pirat
subplot
is
profound
dumb
,
I
was
prepar
to
be
pleasant
sidetrack
by
the
action
sequenc
.
It
's
just
when
I
start
to
think
about
the
stori
that
my
contempt
for
this
film
surfac
.
The
pictur
feel
like
it
's
been
hack
to
piec
--
I
would
n't
be
surpris
if
five
or
six
inept
subplot
have
been
edit
out
complet
.
The
one
that
are
here
are
as
bad
as
they
come
-LRB-
I
think
I
let
out
a
veri
audibl
groan
when
they
get
the
first
glimps
of
the
pirat
ship
-RRB-
,
and
I
'd
just
like
to
shake
the
produc
by
the
shoulder
and
scream
,
``
Whi
did
you
pick
this
aw
script
!?
''
The
film
is
outright
stupid
,
but
some
of
the
element
are
subt
horrifi
.
For
instanc
,
take
the
subplot
in
which
the
Schwimmer
charact
has
sex
with
the
bimbo
,
and
then
feel
realli
guilti
.
This
is
a
serious
problem
in
real
life
,
but
Six
Day
,
Seven
Night
reduc
ani
chanc
of
complex
to
a
weak
plot
devic
:
his
action
are
what
make
it
okay
for
Hech
to
kiss
Ford
.
In
a
script
that
lack
even
a
glimps
of
intellig
subtleti
,
I
find
it
odd
that
such
a
strang
insult
devic
end
up
in
the
stori
.
This
is
summer
movi
season
,
but
that
doe
n't
mean
our
movi
have
to
be
dumb
.
1998
so
far
has
been
one
of
the
worst
year
in
recent
memori
for
summer
blockbust
.
When
I
was
in
line
for
Six
Day
,
Seven
Night
,
I
heard
the
woman
in
front
of
me
ask
for
``
two
ticket
to
that
new
Harrison
Ford
movi
.
''
Whi
did
n't
she
know
the
name
of
the
film
?
I
suppos
she
just
did
n't
care
.
What
bother
me
even
more
is
that
the
peopl
who
make
these
big-budget
pictur
do
n't
realiz
that
their
film
are
becom
parodi
of
themselv
.
Good
actor
should
sign
to
good
script
,
and
if
Hollywood
insist
on
make
flick
to
rake
in
cash
,
they
least
they
could
do
is
assum
that
we
'd
like
to
spend
our
money
on
a
stori
worth
more
than
ten
cent
.
