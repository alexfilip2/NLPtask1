the
pain
of
live
in
the
hereaft
of
death
,
and
deal
with
the
loss
and
grief
that

.
On
a
cold
winter
day
in
a
small
,
isol
town
in
British
Columbia
,
a
school
bus
full
of
children
slide
off
the
highway
and
onto
a
frozen
lake
,
where
it
crack
through
the
ice
and
sink
.
Fourteen
children
die
,
and
numer
other
are
hurt
.
For
the
resid
of
this
small
town
,
all
of
whose
children
were
on
that
bus
,
it
is
an
earth-shatt
event
that
resolut
alter
their
live
.
They
have
alway
reli
on
each
other
in
the
past
to
deal
with
heartach
and
pain
,
but
it
seem
that
this
tragedi
is
more
than
they
can
handl
.
Alberta
and
Risa
Walker
,
who
own
a
local
motel
and
lost
their
child
in
the
accid
,
hire
an
attorney
name
Mitchel
Stephen
-LRB-
Ian
Holm
-RRB-
to
bring
a
lawsuit
against
someon
,
anyon
for
respons
.
The
bus
driver
,
Dolor
Driscol
-LRB-
Gabriell
Rose
-RRB-
,
is
a
kind
woman
who
love
the
children
and
,
although
she
live
with
a
burden
of
guilt
,
is
not
held
respons
for
the
accid
.
The
bus
seem
to
have
simpli
slip
on
some
ice
,
and
there
was
noth
should
could
do
to
prevent
it
.
Howev
,
accord
to
Stephen
,
there
are
no
``
accid
''
in
life
,
and
someon
will
pay
for
this
tragedi
,
whether
that
be
the
manufactur
of
the
bus
or
the
guardrail
the
bus
broke
through
.
He
goe
through
the
town
,
approach
the
parent
who
have
lost
children
,
ask
them
to
join
the
class
action
suit
and
find
vent
for
their
anger
.
And
,
for
his
work
,
Stephen
will
receiv
one-third
of
the
settlement
money
.
Howev
,
it
is
immedi
appar
that
Stephen
has
littl
or
no
interest
in
the
money
.
He
is
driven
by
someth
els
,
someth
deeper
that
he
share
in
common
with
the
griev
parent
.
He
has
lost
a
child
,
too
,
but
not
in
the
same
manner
.
His
daughter
,
Zoe
-LRB-
Caerthan
Bank
-RRB-
,
who
onc
almost
die
in
his
arm
as
a
young
child
after
a
spider
bite
,
has
been
in
and
out
of
drug
re-hab
clinic
and
detox
station
for
ten
year
.
She
call
him
on
an
irregular
basi
,
beg
him
for
money
,
but
refus
to
tell
him
what
she
need
it
for
.
``
I
do
n't
know
who
I
'm
take
to
,
''
he
tell
her
.
In
his
mind
,
his
daughter
is
dead
.
The
lawsuit
is
,
to
Stephen
,
not
onli
a
way
to
mend
the
town
's
pain
,
but
also
his
own
.
Howev
,
not
everyon
in
town
want
it
to
happen
.
Billi
Ansell
-LRB-
Bruce
Greenwood
-RRB-
,
who
was
drive
behind
the
bus
when
the
accid
happen
and
lost
two
children
,
want
noth
to
do
with
it
.
He
has
alreadi
lost
his
wife
,
and
he
buri
his
grief
in
an
affair
with
a
marri
woman
.
He
doe
n't
want
to
talk
about
the
accid
,
and
he
see
the
lawsuit
as
noth
more
than
the
unnecessari
open
of
old
wound
.
To
him
,
the
town
should
be
abl
to
take
care
of
it
own
pain
,
and
it
doe
n't
need
outsid
like
Stephen
get
in
the
way
.
Central
to
``
The
Sweet
Hereaft
''
is
the
tale
of
Nicol
Burnel
-LRB-
Sarah
Polley
-RRB-
,
a
teenag
girl
who
dream
of
be
a
singer
befor
the
accid
turn
her
into
``
a
wheelchair
girl
,
''
as
she
put
it
.
Aside
from
Stephen
,
Nicol
is
the
most
complex
charact
in
the
film
,
and
it
is
she
who
ultim
decid
the
fate
of
the
town
and
how
the
lawsuit
will
turn
out
.
It
is
also
her
sad
,
haunt
voic
that
we
often
hear
on
the
soundtrack
,
read
Robert
Brown
's
poem
about
the
Pie
Piper
,
and
how
when
he
led
all
the
town
's
children
away
,
one
was
left
behind
becaus
he
was
crippl
.
Obviousli
,
Nicol
is
that
child
,
and
she
feel
somehow
betray
that
the
rest
of
the
town
's
children
left
her
alon
by
die
in
the
wreck
.
Her
situat
is
further
complic
becaus
she
is
involv
in
a
love
,
but
incestu
relationship
with
her
father
-LRB-
Tom
McCamus
-RRB-
.
There
is
onli
one
,
fleet
scene
that
suggest
this
relationship
,
but
it
is
somehow
tie
into
the
final
act
of
the
film
.
Of
all
the
storylin
in
``
The
Sweet
Hereaft
,
''
this
is
the
most
complic
and
unresolv
,
although
it
implic
stretch
throughout
the
entireti
of
the
film
.
Egoyan
know
that
the
kind
of
question
he
bring
up
have
no
simpl
answer
--
if
ani
at
all
--
and
he
doe
n't
condescend
to
the
audienc
by
tri
to
neat
wrap
it
up
.
What
Egoyan
has
done
in
``
The
Sweet
Hereaft
''
is
realli
noth
short
of
miracul
.
In
his
adapt
of
the
novel
by
Russel
Bank
,
he
has
made
a
deepli
move
film
about
a
lawyer
by
transcend
the
petti
of
law
and
drive
headlong
into
the
deeper
mean
of
what
is
loss
,
and
how
piti
monetari
and
materi
possess
are
when
compar
to
human
life
.
Egoyan
has
alway
been
a
talent
,
but
distant
and
cerebr
filmmak
whose
work
suffer
onli
in
that
it
felt
so
cold
.
``
The
Sweet
Hereaft
''
is
quit
the
opposit
;
Egoyan
's
stylist
and
narrat
structur
work
brilliant
to
heighten
the
impact
of
the
natur
emot
,
and
draw
the
audienc
into
the
tragedi
.
``
The
Sweet
Hereaft
''
seem
to
contain
the
combin
emot
impact
that
all
his
other
film
lack
.
The
film
is
fill
with
beauti
,
subtl
perform
from
all
the
actor
,
especi
Ian
Holm
as
the
lawyer
and
Sarah
Polley
as
the
sad
child
who
was
left
behind
.
The
beauti
,
rove
camerawork
by
Paul
Sarossi
and
the
haunt
,
melod
music
score
by
Mychael
Danna
-LRB-
both
previous
Egoyan
collabor
-RRB-
give
the
film
a
visual
and
aural
cohes
with
the
themat
element
.
Like
his
earlier
film
,
Egoyan
weav
togeth
multipl
storylin
that
form
a
blanket
whole
.
He
work
with
time
as
a
fluid
substanc
,
shift
back
and
forth
between
the
past
,
the
distant
past
,
and
the
present
with
effortless
eas
.
The
actual
bus
wreck
itself
doe
n't
happen
until
midway
through
the
film
,
but
by
that
time
the
event
has
built
up
so
much
emot
that
Egoyan
can
film
it
from
a
distanc
with
no
graphic
detail
,
and
still
have
it
carri
great
,
devast
weight
.
Becaus
human
life
has
becom
such
a
cheap
commod
in
movi
,
it
is
astound
that
Egoyan
can
convey
so
much
heartbreak
in
such
simpl
,
direct
term
.
Certain
one
of
the
best
film
of
1997
,
``
The
Sweet
Hereaft
''
is
a
deepli
reward
,
mystifi
,
and
ultim
human
film
.
