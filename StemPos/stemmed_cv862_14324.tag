It

for

The
film
take
place
in
Georgia
befor
,
dure
,
and
after
the
Civil
War
.
This
play
a
major
factor
in

To

no

It

Can

The

We
re
given
some
backstori
here
and
learn
a
littl
about
our
charact
,
especi
our
main
charact
,
Scarlett
O'Hara
-LRB-
Leigh
-RRB-
,
a
beauti
Southern
Bell
with
a
will
of
steel
,
a
cun
wit
,
and
a
tremend
sens
of
liberti
in
such
an
oppress
time
.
She
know
how
her
societi
work
,
wherein
everyth
she
doe
can
and
will
play
a
role
in
the
shape
of
her
life
and
those
around
her
.
Right
from
the
begin
we
realiz
how
determin
she
is
to
have
her
way
no
matter
what
the
consequ
may
be
.
Be
the
most
sought-aft
woman
allow
her
to
manipul
men
-LRB-
and
their
women
-RRB-
to
ensur
she
get
her
way
,
whether
it
be
obvious
-LRB-
i.e.
who
will
be
the
one
to
get
her
food
-RRB-
,
or
subtl
-LRB-
i.e.
get
marri
just
to
spite
someon
-RRB-
.
The
man
she
claim
to
love
is
Ashley
Wilk
-LRB-
Howard
-RRB-
,
a
modest
gentleman
who
doe
not
seem
to
have
the
same
passion
for
her
as
she
doe
for
him
.
He
is
n't
so
arrog
and
demand
as
Scarlett
,
in
fact
,
he
's
engag
to
a
woman
with
a
person
much
more
like
his
.
Her
name
is
Melani
-LRB-
De
Havilland
-RRB-
,
and
she
is
one
of
the
sweetest
,
kindest
,
and
most
likabl
charact
one
will
ever
see
.
She
and
Scarlett
becom
veri
dear
friend
,
but
she
never
suspect
the
jealous
Scarlett
has
for
her
,
and
the
love
she
has
for
her
husband
.
Her
meek
is
both
her
strongest
and
weakest
characteristic-it
defin
who
she
is
,
but
doe
n't
give
her
much
emot
self-defens
.
Acting
a
catalyst
to
the
love
triangl
,
and
to
the
stori
as
a
whole
is
the
daper
,
stong-wil
,
cun
,
cocki
Southern
busi
and
militari
man
Captain
Rhett
Butler
-LRB-
Gabl
-RRB-
.
He
's
quit
a
charact
all
right-everyon
listen
to
what
he
has
to
say
even
though
he
's
got
a
bad
reput
.
Butler
make
no
apolog
for
his
vast
amount
of
money
nor
his
behavior
.
He
tell
everyon
the
much-need
truth
in
the
rigid
caste-lik
societi
where
freewil
doe
n't
seem
to
exist
,
everyth
is
done
out
of
honor
and
tradit
.
For
exampl
,
in
his
first
appear
Butler
tell
his
fellow
Southern
there
's
no
way
the
South
could
defeat
the
North
if
war
were
to
break
out
.
This
anger
them
,
not
for
his
lack
of
faith
,
but
becaus
he
has
the
gall
to
say
it
aloud
and
boast
at
that
.
``
Do
we
have
ammunit
factori
?
''
Do
we
have
food
?
Do
we
have
a
navi
?
All
we
have
is
tobacco
.
''
''
All
true
statement
and
yet
the
South
still
insist
he
's
wrong
.
Butler
is
a
shifti
charact
to
be
sure
,
but
he
take
such
pride
in
his
arrog
it
's
appeal
.
Scarlett
notic
this
too
when
she
first
see
him
,
and
from
the
look
Butler
give
her
,
we
know
he
's
not
go
to
stop
until
he
has
her
.
But
Scarlett
ca
n't
get
past
her
need
for
Ashley
,
and
dure
a
scene
which
set
the
stage
for
the
grand
stori
,
Butler
learn
of
this
and
continu
to
throw
it
back
at
Scarlett
forev
.
And
so
the
stori
goe
on
,
with
Scarlett
be
thrown
obstacl
after
obstacl
in
her
life
.
The
conflict
she
must
overcom
rang
from
take
care
of
her
entir
famili
to
find
a
proper
husband
,
especi
after
she
is
``
mark
''
for
life
when
her
first
husband
die
.
This
give
the
film
mani
opportun
to
bring
in
more
charact
into
the
epic
stori
.
Some
are
vital
for
onli
a
few
scene
,
but
their
true
signifc
will
endur
throughout
the
film
.
In
most
film
onli
a
few
charact
exist
for
support
in
background
,
but
this
film
is
more
realist
and
believ
as
it
incorpor
a
support
cast
the
size
of
a
small
town
and
everyon
has
signfic
.
Even
peopl
in
the
background
seem
more
than
just
extra
wander
the
set
.
The
costum
design
is
outstand
so
that
the
film
make
for
a
real
sens
of
time
and
place
.
The
filmmak
could
have
easili
set
more
scene
indoor
and
narrowli
focus
to
avoid
have
to
show
the
outsid
,
real
world
,
but
these
type
of
simpl
approach
are
never
taken
.
The
first
half
of
the
film
depict
the
traumat
experi
the
South
face
at
the
last
day
of
the
Civil
War
.
Fleme
is
abl
to
convey
the
horror
of
it
all
by
paint
an
imag
of
destruct
and
let
the
viewer
decid
just
how
bad
it
is
.
One
scene
has
Scarlett
work
as
a
nurs
at
a
militari
hospit
while
we
hear
a
soldier
in
the
background
scream
,
``
No
!
''
Not
my
leg
!
Do
n't
cut
off
my
leg
!
''
''
Another
scene
show
her
simpli
tri
to
cross
a
street
,
but
as
the
camera
pull
back
,
we
see
that
her
path
is
block
by
hundr
of
wound
soldier
,
but
it
is
their
moan
that
's
more
graphic
than
all
the
bloodi
gore
could
ever
be
.
As
the
second
half
begin
,
the
film
concentr
more
on
Scarlett
as
a
complet
independ
woman
who
single-hand
take
care
of
her
famili
and
Melani
just
to
spite
the
tyrani
of
the
North
.
She
manag
to
resurrect
the
famili
plantat
,
but
all
the
willpow
she
has
ca
n't
help
her
when
she
must
pay
exuberh
tax
set
by
the
North
after
the
South
's
ultim
defeat
.
This
bring
Rhett
Butler
back
into
the
pictur
and
thus
begin
their
torrid
love-h
relationship
.
Most
of
the
second
half
of
the
film
is
somehow
relat
to
the
relationship
-LRB-
or
lack
thereof
-RRB-
between
Rhett
and
Scarlett
.
Each
use
the
other
for
person
gain
,
but
at
the
same
time
they
still
feel
an
intim
connect
with
each
other
.
Scarlett
continu
to
use
her
manipul
power
over
men
to
get
what
she
want
and
becaus
Rhett
ca
n't
help
but
want
her
more
everi
time
she
tri
to
one-up
him
such
as
marri
anoth
man
and
take
over
his
busi
.
They
say
opposit
attract
,
but
the
conflict
between
Rhett
and
Scarlett
goe
way
beyond
oppos
person
,
it
border
on
magnet
polar
.
They
need
each
other
and
know
this
,
yet
they
never
seem
truli
happi
togeth
.
Perhap
they
mistak
love
for
passion
,
and
the
film
leav
it
up
to
us
to
make
this
call
.
Both
have
thing
the
other
want
and
vice
versa
,
but
when
they
compromis
,
is
it
just
to
get
their
own
way
or
becaus
they
actual
care
for
each
other
.
Love
and
the
percept
of
love
are
two
complet
separ
thing
and
throughout
the
final
act
of
the
film
,
we
re
left
wonder
if
Rhett
and
Scarlett
ever
truli
love
each
other
and
whi
.
Gabl
and
Leigh
do
have
great
chemistri
,
alway
leav
the
viewer
wonder
which
emot
were
authent
and
which
were
manufactur
.
All
?
None
?
Either
way
is
possibl
and
it
's
a
mysteri
that
can
not
be
solv
even
upon
repeat
view
.
It
's
safe
to
say
most
of
us
wo
n't
live
such
over
dramat
live
as
those
in
``
Gone
With
The
Wind
,
''
but
it
's
still
a
masterpiec
for
it
abil
to
give
us
a
sens
that
we
ve
just
experienc
a
life
's
worth
of
joy
and
pain
.
