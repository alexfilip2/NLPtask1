As
we
see
the
terribl
event
that
unfold
befor
our
eye
in
the
Middl
East
at
the
moment
,
Hollywood
doe
n't
lose
the
oppertun
to
get
involv
,
by
tell
stori
and
express
opinion
.
This
film
center
on
a
relationship
forg
throughout
the
adult
lifetim
of
two
Marin
colonel
,
Hay
Hodg
-LRB-
Tommi
Lee
Jone
-RRB-
and
Terri
Childer
-LRB-
Samuel
L.
Jackson
-RRB-
.
They
fought
side
by
side
in
Vietnam
,
where
Childer
save
Hodg
'
life
by
shoot
an
unarm
POW
.
That
's
against
the
rule
of
war
but
understand
,
in
this
stori
anyway
,
under
the
specif
circumst
.
Certain
Hodg
is
not
complain
.
year
pass
.
Hodg
,
whose
wound
make
him
unfit
for
action
,
get
a
law
degre
and
becom
a
Marin
lawyer
.
Childer
,
is
now
a
respect
and
much-decor
hero
that
has
serv
his
countri
with
his
life
and
sould
.
Becaus
of
his
excel
record
,
Childer
is
sent
to
yemen
to
rescu
the
American
ambassador
-LRB-
Ben
Kingsley
-RRB-
,
cower
in
the
embassi
under
assault
from
violent
demonstr
and
sniper
blast
from
rooftop
.
Childer
doe
what
he
has
to
do
:
evacu
the
famili
and
protect
the
men
under
his
command
.
After
three
Marin
die
and
the
colonel
think
he
see
ground
fire
,
he
order
his
troop
to
shoot
into
the
fire
crowd
.
More
than
80
yemeni
men
,
women
,
and
children
are
mow
down
.
Childer
is
immedi
accus
of
order
his
men
to
fire
on
a
crowd
and
murder
of
unarm
civilian
.
He
persuad
his
old
friend
Hodg
to
repres
him
in
the
courtroom
drama
that
occupi
the
second
half
of
the
film
.
Did
Childer
violat
author
U.S.
militari
rule
of
engag
?
Or
are
there
simpli
no
rule
in
war
?
The
answer
to
these
stereotyp
question
are
obvious
,
but
the
inconsist
plot
immedi
rais
all
sort
of
other
question
.
The
murder
of
83
``
innoc
civilian
''
has
to
result
into
someth
greater
than
a
simpl
trial
in
the
U.S.
Where
is
the
accus
from
the
Arab
leader
?
Where
is
the
U.N.
?
The
film
end
without
even
tell
the
most
interest
stori
:
what
happen
on
the
intern
arena
?
This
film
-LRB-
in
a
way
akin
to
film
such
as
``
A
Few
Good
Men
''
-RRB-
has
alreadi
been
accus
of
break
the
rule
of
moral
and
ethic
and
even
of
racism
.
These
accus
are
pretti
heavi
,
but
also
unfair
.
What
director
William
Friedklin
truli
broke
was
the
rule
of
decent
filmmak
.
One
of
the
earliest
appar
problem
with
'
Rule
of
Engagement
'
is
it
lack
of
credibl
.
The
entir
oper
in
yemen
may
remind
us
about
what
happen
in
the
Middl
East
right
now
,
but
is
overdon
,
contriv
and
unrealistic-a
if
a
chain
of
event
had
to
happen
in
a
particular
manner
in
order
for
the
plot
to
proceed
.
A
lot
of
it
is
so
cheesi
that
no
one
could
possibl
accept
it
as
realiti
.
That
is
precis
whi
it
's
not
offens
.
It
is
complet
unobject
.
Mani
stori
are
start
and
never
finish
.
Mani
question
are
ask
,
but
never
answer
.
A
lot
of
parallel
are
refer
to
noth
.
It
seem
that
neither
the
director
,
produc
or
the
screenwrit
can
make
up
their
mind
about
the
content
of
their
film
.
Is
it
about
Arab
mental
?
America
's
foreign
polici
?
America
's
role
in
the
world
?
Corrupt
in
the
higher
circl
?
It
goe
on
and
on
.
It
consist
of
countless
stori
,
but
not
a
defin
plot
.
It
tri
to
be
everyth
for
everyon
and
end
up
be
noth
for
no
one
.
I
think
that
it
is
iron
,
becaus
director
William
Friedkin
's
probabl
most
acclaim
film
was
``
The
Exorcist
''
which
had
a
silli
stori
,
but
becam
a
rather
effect
film
.
In
this
case
you
have
a
strong
stori
with
mani
possibl
and
the
result
is
a
silli
film
.
Though
sever
scene
bare
the
mark
of
profession
-LRB-
such
as
the
impress
battl
scene
-RRB-
,
his
latest
film
doe
simpli
not
engag
.
I
believ
that
Friedklin
is
a
director
that
is
absolut
depend
on
great
script
and
talent
produc
in
order
to
succeed
.
It
's
obvious
that
he
has
neither
and
the
result
is
therefor
a
catastroph
.
The
charact
feel
design
,
unreal
,
mere
shadow
,
with
no
life
outsid
the
conflict
.
Even
the
actor
can
not
save
this
film
from
go
under
.
Though
both
Jackson
and
Jone
act
admir
,
with
perform
that
are
as
good
as
you
get
with
a
script
like
this
,
it
is
not
someth
that
these
great
actor
can
boast
of
.
They
have
role
that
they
could
play
blindfold
with
their
hand
on
the
back
.
Jackson
is
gray
and
Jone
uninterest
.
The
rest
of
the
cast
,
includ
Ben
Kingsli
,
Blair
Underwood
and
Guy
Pearc
are
simpli
wait
for
their
paycheck
.
The
time
has
come
for
the
verdict
.
On
the
charg
of
complet
lack
of
object
,
I
find
this
film
guilti
.
On
the
charg
of
break
the
rule
of
reason
filmmak
,
I
find
it
guilti
.
But
on
the
charg
of
racism
I
find
this
film
not
guilti
,
becaus
of
it
's
inconclus
and
often
silli
plot
that
lack
object
everywher
,
not
onli
when
concern
the
Arab
popul
.
I
must
admit
that
the
film
is
danger
near
the
line
of
be
racial
offens
and
I
do
think
that
screenwrit
Stephen
Gaghan
went
a
bit
too
far
,
portray
the
yemeni
peopl
almost
as
stereotyp
Hollywood
bad-guy
.
This
is
veri
sad
,
sinc
in
a
time
like
this
it
is
crucial
to
not
lose
object
and
proclaim
the
truth
.
Howev
,
it
is
absolut
necessari
to
rememb
that
the
Muslim
terrorist
are
respons
for
most
of
the
terrorist
activ
in
and
outsid
the
Unite
State
.
And
that
it
's
not
a
coincid
that
U.S.
resid
in
the
Middl
East
,
includ
yemen
are
on
constant
maximum
alert
.
