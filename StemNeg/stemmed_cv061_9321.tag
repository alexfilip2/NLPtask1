Okay
,
here
's
the
deal
.
I
ll
be
the
first
one
to
grant
that
everybodi
need
a
day
off
now
and
then
.
I
ll
even
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
a
vacat
is
a
necessari
part
of
do
ani
job
well
.
I
mean
,
hey
,
I
ve
been
known
to
stretch
a
weekend
into
a
three-day
outing
,
if
Friday
look
to
be
a
slow
day
.
And
if
Monday
ai
n't
look
like
a
pick-me-up
,
well
,
I
ve
been
known
to
give
Martha
Nell
a
call
and
say
,
``
Do
me
a
favor
,
sweetheart
.
''
Bump
Old
Man
Ferguson
's
boil
lanc
to
Tuesday
morn
,
and
tell
Miss
Audrey
that
I
ll
swing
by
her
hous
Monday
even
and
see
if
we
ca
n't
get
her
trick
knee
back
in
line
.
''
''
A
simpl
sentenc
like
that
,
and
I
ve
got
a
nice
four-day
fish
trip
with
the
boy
,
or
more
often
than
not
,
a
trip
up
to
Cheroke
,
N.C.
,
for
jackpot
bingo
and
assort
other
mountain
funneri
.
But
the
point
is
,
if
you
take
a
day
off
,
do
someth
differ
.
If
you
ve
work
yourself
silli
for
month
,
relax
a
bit
.
Sleep
in
.
Eat
pancak
at
noon
.
Microwav
an
egg
in
it
shell
.
Watch
pro
wrestl
with
the
sound
off
.
Listen
to
some
Barri
White
record
at
high
speed
.
Whatev
.
But
do
not
,
under
ani
circumst
,
spend
your
vacat
do
the
same
thing
you
do
for
a
live
.
And
,
if
you
do
,
do
n't
make
the
final
product
look
ten
time
wors
than
it
would
ani
other
time
.
Becaus
I
do
not
want
to
hear
your
sob
stori
,
Oliver
Stone
.
you
appar
thought
you
need
a
break
from
make
``
import
film
.
''
Cool
.
So
you
found
this
hinki
littl
book
and
decid
to
make
it
a
movi
.
That
's
cool
,
too
.
But
,
Ollie
,
old
sage
,
do
not
take
a
good
stori
and
a
hot
cast
and
make
one
of
the
most
pointless
and
worthless
film
of
the
decad
.
I
'm
just
eager
to
meet
you
one
day
,
so
I
can
buy
you
a
Stoli
,
look
you
in
the
eye
and
say
,
``
What
in
the
Wide
World
of
Sport
were
you
think
with
U-Turn
?
''
And
I
ll
stand
there
stare
til
I
get
a
straight
answer
.
Sean
Penn
star
U-Turn
,
as
Bobbi
,
a
drifter
who
's
had
some
troubl
a
while
back
.
He
's
head
cross
the
desert
minus
two
finger
when
his
Mustang
ragtop
blow
a
radiat
hose
,
strand
him
in
Superior
,
Arizona
,
held
there
by
an
``
ignor
,
inbr
,
turtleneck
hick
''
of
a
mechan
name
Darrel
.
While
Darrel
put
a
new
hose
on
the
ride
,
Bobbi
walk
into
town
to
see
what
's
cook
.
Is
it
needless
of
me
to
say
that
Superior
,
Arizona
,
is
not
exact
the
shini
scrub
home
of
all
thing
love
?
Probabl
not
.
Bobbi
meet
up
with
Grace
-LRB-
Jennif
Lopez
-RRB-
,
who
invit
him
back
to
her
place
,
for
drape-hang
and
other
domest
issu
.
Just
as
those
issu
are
start
up
,
Grace
's
husband
,
Jake
,
storm
in
,
look
like
check-out
day
of
the
Elks
Lodg
Convent
.
Just
beat
Bobbi
silli
.
Bobbi
take
to
the
road
,
onli
to
meet
up
with
Jake
again
,
and
Jake
ask
Bobbi
to
kill
Grace
.
A
littl
while
later
,
Grace
ask
Bobbi
to
kill
Jake
.
Them
murder
Arizonian
.
Got
ta
love
em
.
If
ani
of
this
sound
familiar
,
congratul
.
you
win
a
kewpi
doll
.
The
stori
is
a
straight
shoplift
of
Red
Rock
West
,
a
cult
favorit
a
few
year
back
from
John
Dahl
,
maker
of
the
phenomen
The
Last
Seduct
.
But
the
contest
doe
n't
end
there
,
guy
and
gal
.
We
get
steal
from
Russ
Meyer
movi
,
where
everybodi
in
town
is
horni
and
sweati
.
We
get
the
town
from
Bad
Day
at
Black
Rock
,
minus
the
train
,
plus
busti
women
who
can
speak
.
Look
at
ani
Schwarzenegg
film
,
and
you
ll
see
our
hero
,
Bobbi
,
as
Bobbi
has
a
mudhol
stomp
in
his
keister
a
dozen
time
,
has
his
rib
stove
in
at
least
fifteen
time
,
get
bit
by
a
tarantula
,
get
shot
at
,
and
end
up
with
vultur
circl
overhead
,
all
the
while
get
up
like
he
just
got
a
shave
nick
.
Bobbi
as
Termin
?
Stretch
it
a
bit
,
and
we
have
a
five-fing
discount
from
Doc
Hollywood
,
where
the
whole
stori
occur
becaus
of
car
troubl
,
forc
the
main
charact
to
stay
at
the
merci
of
the
town
and
the
mechan
.
Okay
,
he
's
work
from
a
book
,
so
mayb
Ollie
's
not
total
to
blame
for
blatant
cop
these
idea
.
I
just
expect
a
man
who
can
make
up
an
altern
histori
of
the
Unite
State
to
be
abl
to
craft
a
few
origin
idea
befor
expos
the
negat
.
I
just
wish
he
had
n't
brought
a
cast
like
this
togeth
for
what
amount
to
a
group
toe-stub
.
Sean
Penn
give
a
great
perform
,
and
Jennif
Lopez
and
Nick
Nolt
are
as
on
target
as
they
can
be
,
play
over-the-top
caricatur
of
stereotyp
charact
.
The
best
thing
about
the
movi
is
watch
Penn
react
to
the
mad
around
him
and
tri
to
figur
out
exact
what
the
blankety-blank
is
go
on
.
Too
bad
it
's
not
fun
to
watch
when
it
's
happen
to
us
...
while
we
sit
through
this
mess
of
a
film
.
U-Turn
is
not
a
bad
film
if
you
re
a
fan
of
techniqu
.
It
's
the
Oliver
Stone
you
ve
alway
known
.
Robert
Richardson
is
his
usual
cinematograph
,
and
Rob
and
Ollie
know
how
to
shoot
a
flick
--
great
camera
angl
,
shift
viewpoint
,
wick
color
,
nice
look
pictur
.
But
pictur
of
what
?
I
think
I
'd
rather
stare
at
a
xerox
envelop
for
two
hour
than
tri
to
figur
out
the
Tilt-o-Whirl
point
of
this
loser
film
.
Plot
twist
are
one
thing
,
repetit
is
almost
unforgiv
,
and
this
is
dang
near
as
unforgiv
as
ani
movi
I
ve
seen
in
the
past
five
year
.
Oliver
,
I
know
your
bodi
of
work
is
noth
to
sniff
at
.
you
ve
been
nice
enough
to
limit
us
to
onli
one
Door
movi
,
and
film
like
Platoon
,
JFK
,
Wall
Street
and
Nixon
give
us
plenti
to
dig
on
.
your
script
are
certain
respect
,
your
budget
are
up
there
on
the
screen
,
and
your
actor
do
n't
dog
it
.
And
I
know
that
,
mayb
,
with
U-Turn
,
you
were
just
kick
back
,
just
have
fun
.
That
's
fine
.
But
do
n't
do
that
with
a
movi
with
the
potenti
of
this
one
.
Do
some
Polic
Academi
sequel
-LRB-
imagin
that
.
-RRB-
Do
a
big
comedi
,
like
a
remak
of
It
's
a
Mad
,
Mad
,
Mad
,
Mad
World
.
But
do
not
drop
a
limp
U-Turn
out
of
your
pocket
and
expect
us
to
accept
it
as
``
An
Oliver
Stone
Movi
,
''
and
not
question
whi
it
stink
like
week-old
snook
.
There
's
a
right
way
to
have
fun
,
and
a
wrong
way
to
have
fun
.
This
was
as
wrong
as
you
can
get
without
go
to
jail
.
