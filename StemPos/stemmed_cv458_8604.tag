It
show
that
America
remain
ambival
over
the
natur
of
it
polit
system
.
No
major
surpris
,
when
J.
S.
Mill
in
his
Victorian
classic
On
Liberti
could
not
make
up
his
mind
over
liber
democraci
either
.
The
American
are
wrought
by
the
archetyp
paradox
under
which
they
exist
,
the
suprem
contradict
between
the
right
of
the
one
and
the
right
of
the
major
.
Small
wonder
that
Hollywood
's
most
compel
movi
have
oft
been
on
the
struggl
of
the
individual-underdog
against
some
larger
collect
oppressive-wit
Braveheart
,
Born
on
the
Fourth
of
Juli
,
Rocki
,
First
Blood
,
Clear
and
Present
Danger
,
JFK
,
the
list
goe
on
.
There
's
littl
of
that
in
Singapore-w
are
bar
access
to
Playboy
and
Penthous
both
on
and
off
line
,
though
the
govern
's
been
long
worri
about
the
younger
peopl
get
``
Americanis
''
and
advoc
individu
right
and
parliamentari
opposit
.
The
Peopl
vs.
Larri
Flynt
locat
the
polit
debat
within
the
greatest
social
taboo
in
America-sex
.
Doe
pornographi
have
a
right
to
exist
and
circul
?
Larri
Flynt
,
the
publish
of
Hustler
magazin
,
think
so
,
and
obvious
so
too
the
U.S.
Congress
which
last
month
threw
out
a
Bill
to
curb
pornographi
on
the
Net
.
But
even
with
such
action
,
American
remain
undecid
.
The
Oscar
appar
shun
the
movi
becaus
it
was
an
embarrass
and
sensit
livewir
.
What
they
have
ignor
is
actual
a
great
pictur
.
Woodi
Harrelson
as
the
lead
charact
repris
his
role
as
a
to-hell-with-mor
,
to-hell-with-the-law
,
and
to-hell-with-the-system
anti-Christ
that
we
last
saw
in
Natur
Born
Killer
.
And
he
is
outrag
and
convinc
as
a
nihilist
atheist
who
nonetheless
love
his
ex-stripp
wife
dear
.
The
latter
is
play
with
abandon
,
convict
and
sensit
all
at
onc
by
Courtney
Love
,
who
is
the
real
star
of
the
show
and
realli
snub
of
an
Academi
Award
Best
Actress
nomin
,
if
not
of
the
award
itself
.
Edward
Norton
play
their
jerki
lawyer
.
The
relationship
between
Harrelson
and
Love
bring
out
anoth
great
paradox-superfici
they
are
immor
outcast
who
ve
had
it
come
;
Woodi
get
shot
and
becom
paralys
from
the
waist
down
,
and
Courtney
die
of
Aid
.
God
's
damnat
.
But
in
the
power
love
they
have
for
each
other
,
each
stand
by
the
other
in
turn
,
the
two
lead
highlight
the
question
how
much
is
the
nihilist
still
a
moralist
and
-LRB-
in
the
American
context
-RRB-
a
Christian
,
if
they
can
love
and
care
,
and
feel
just
like
anyon
els
on
a
person
level
.
Friedrich
Nietzsch
onc
talk
about
how
the
atheist
must
uncov
for
himself
the
full
consequ
of
atheism
by
rid
himself
of
all
moral-Christian
influenc
.
To
go
beyond
good
and
evil
.
This
is
a
great
pictur
,
no
doubt
,
and
I
love
it
person
.
Becaus
it
is
move
,
funni
,
end
with
open
American
optim
blah
blah
.
But
I
like
it
and
admir
it
becaus
it
come
from
a
fine
American
tradit
that
dare
to
rais
difficult
question
,
and
call
into
doubt
idea
and
doctrin
that
otherwis
are
use
as
catchphras
.
There
are
time
when
movi
go
beyond
the
stori
they
tell
and
reflect
someth
of
hidden
realiti
.
This
movi
is
not
so
much
about
Larri
Flynt
,
but
about
American
and
American
societi
.
