Some
may
be
disappoint
with
The
Matrix
.
I
ll
tell
you
I
was
.
I
sat
there
and
sat
there
and
sat
there
wait
for
someth
to
happen
.
Now
wait
wait
,
I
know
most
of
you
love
it
,
and
I
'm
not
say
I
did
n't
like
it
.
What
I
'm
say
is
the
first
half
was
extrem
slow
.
Now
see
the
trailer
it
make
you
think
the
whole
entir
movi
is
one
big
special
effect
show
.
Do
n't
be
fool
,
this
movi
has
a
big
stori
.
And
big
chunk
of
talki
moment
.
But
I
will
admit
the
special
effect
and
the
act
were
abov
par
,
deserv
the
rate
abov
.
Ok
now
to
the
stori
.
Well
this
may
take
a
while
.
Ok
first
of
all
,
our
world
we
live
in
now
,
is
not
the
real
world
,
actual
we
live
insid
a
comput
generat
world
known
as
The
Matrix
.
A
man
play
by
Keanu
Reev
is
about
to
find
that
out
,
when
is
kidnap
and
almost
coax
to
go
into
the
real
world
.
He
doe
so
,
and
find
out
that
he
can
do
anyth
,
be
anyth
he
want
to
be
.
But
he
has
to
fight
a
'
Matrix
skip
'
bad
guy
,
who
want
to
send
him
back
to
his
own
world
or
destroy
him
.
Laurenc
Fishburn
,
his
guid
of
sort
play
his
charact
well
as
doe
Keanu
Reev
.
But
I
sat
in
the
theatr
for
over
and
hour
wonder
where
all
the
special
effect
were
.
yeah
there
were
some
in
the
first
half
but
not
enough
.
The
trailer
for
this
movi
was
realli
deciev
make
peopl
think
that
this
was
a
special
effect
laden
movi
.
Now
for
the
second
half
,
it
is
explos
,
and
save
the
movi
.
Some
of
the
special
effect
and
fight
were
breathtak
.
The
sound
,
the
music
,
and
all
the
effect
were
effect
,
and
the
last
hour
kept
us
entertain
.
But
with
a
run
time
of
2
hour
and
20
minut
,
this
movi
is
at
least
40
minut
too
long
.
One
would
have
wish
for
a
better
'
Matrix
'
,
but
I
do
have
to
say
,
I
did
like
it
and
I
was
entertain
.
