By
the
time
Denni
Quaid
,
the
ostens
star
of
SWITCHBACK
,
make
his
first
appear
at
about
the
22-minut
mark
,
you
may
find
yourself
wonder
whi
he
bother
.
After
all
,
writer/director
Jeb
Stuart
has
alreadi
set
up
a
fair
promis
pair
of
parallel
stori
line
.
The
first
find
Amarillo
,
Texa
sheriff
Buck
Olmstead
-LRB-
R.
Lee
Ermey
-RRB-
face
a
hotly-contest
elect
battl
just
as
a
brutal
doubl
homicid
is
discov
at
a
motel
in
his
jurisdict
.
As
Olmstead
begin
his
investig
,
we
also
meet
the
two
men
who
come
to
be
our
prime
suspect
.
Lane
Dixon
-LRB-
Jare
Leto
-RRB-
is
an
enigmat
young
hitchhik
;
Bob
Goodal
-LRB-
Danni
Glover
-RRB-
is
the
jovial
motorist
who
offer
Lane
a
ride
from
Texa
to
his
Utah
destin
.
All
the
necessari
conflict
seem
to
be
in
place
--
the
intern
struggl
of
Olmstead
over
the
clash
between
good
polit
and
good
polic
work
,
and
the
extern
struggl
as
one
of
the
two
travel
eventu
becom
villain
to
the
other
's
protagonist
.
But
then
Quaid
show
up
as
grim
determin
FBI
agent
Frank
LaCross
.
LaCross
is
certain
that
the
Amarillo
murder
are
the
work
of
a
serial
killer
he
has
been
track
for
near
two
year
.
He
's
not
suppos
to
be
track
him
ani
more
--
accord
to
the
Bureau
,
they
ve
got
their
man
--
but
LaCross
has
a
veri
import
reason
for
believ
otherwis
.
Two
month
earlier
,
LaCross
's
own
son
was
kidnap
by
the
killer
,
and
the
boy
has
yet
to
turn
up
anywher
.
LaCross
know
his
killer
's
work
,
and
he
know
that
the
man
is
still
out
there
somewher
tri
to
continu
their
game
.
It
would
n't
be
fair
to
reduc
everyth
that
's
wrong
with
SWITCHBACK
to
Quaid
's
presenc
,
but
it
's
a
pretti
good
place
to
start
.
There
's
a
reason
LaCross
feel
like
an
intrud
in
the
narrat
instead
of
it
vital
center
:
as
a
dramat
actor
,
Denni
Quaid
possess
exact
one
facial
express
and
one
vocal
inton
.
We
can
tell
LaCross
is
determin
becaus
his
face
is
a
perpetu
tight-jaw
,
sourpuss
pucker
;
we
can
tell
he
's
grim
becaus
everi
word
come
out
in
an
Eastwood-esqu
rasp
.
A
more
flexibl
perform
might
have
given
weight
to
the
charact
,
pull
the
audienc
into
his
haunt
intens
,
make
SWITCHBACK
_
his
_
film
.
Quaid
mere
look
annoy
and
slight
constip
.
It
's
tough
to
becom
emot
invest
in
a
charact
's
turmoil
when
it
look
like
all
he
realli
need
is
a
big
bowl
of
bran
flake
.
Even
without
Quaid
,
it
doe
n't
appear
that
SWITCHBACK
would
have
stay
on
cours
.
The
earli
scene
between
Leto
and
Glover
have
a
live
energi
,
build
our
curios
over
which
man
--
the
taciturn
kid
or
his
gregari
benefactor
--
is
the
real
threat
.
Unfortun
,
Stuart
tip
his
hand
far
too
earli
in
the
game
,
both
through
the
pitch
of
the
individu
perform
and
the
fact
he
choos
to
reveal
.
Once
the
mysteri
of
the
killer
's
ident
is
dispatch
,
the
interact
between
Leto
and
Glover
becom
stale
and
predict
.
In
fact
,
``
stale
and
predict
''
describ
the
direct
that
SWITCHBACK
take
in
general
,
fall
back
on
far-too-common
Hollywood
devic
like
cat
jump
out
of
nowher
,
a
climact
fistfight
on
board
a
freight
train
,
and
edgi
law
enforc
agent
.
It
's
too
bad
Stuart
was
n't
will
to
spend
more
time
with
Sheriff
Olmstead
,
far
and
away
the
most
interest
and
appeal
charact
in
the
film
.
Play
with
atyp
restraint
by
R.
Lee
Ermey
,
he
's
a
wonder
,
unconvent
hero
who
seem
genuin
comfort
accept
the
consequ
of
act
on
his
convict
.
A
film
focus
on
the
Olmstead
would
have
signal
a
film-mak
will
to
take
a
few
risk
with
his
cast
and
story-tel
.
Instead
,
Stuart
place
his
trust
in
a
``
name
''
star
who
ca
n't
carri
the
materi
.
Mayb
next
time
he
ll
throw
away
that
one
crucial
page
in
the
script
,
the
one
where
the
grim
determin
FBI
agent
wander
onto
the
scene
to
muck
up
a
perfect
good
stori
.
