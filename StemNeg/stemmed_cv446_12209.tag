Here
is
a
movi
that
sad
follow
the
Hong
Kong-recip
of
moviemak
and
storytel
to
the
letter
.
These
kind
of
movi
are
mark
by
an
eye-open
sequenc
that
introduc
us
to
the
main
charact
;
a
life-and-death
plot
in
which
these
charact
becom
involv
;
the
inclus
of
a
host
of
inconsequenti
charact
;
ridicul
subplot
,
and
sunglass-wear
henchmen
.
That
is
not
to
say
that
I
do
n't
like
Hong
Kong
influenc
movi
;
howev
,
it
is
quit
obvious
that
these
moviemak
have
n't
a
clue
that
the
American
filmgoer
need
more
than
hip-hop-talk
thug
and
stupid
sight
gag
.
Observ
the
open
sequenc
.
A
band
of
hitmen
are
about
to
storm
an
apart
,
led
by
Melvin
-LRB-
Mark
Wahlberg
-RRB-
and
Cisco
-LRB-
Lou
Diamond
Phillip
-RRB-
.
They
are
wait
for
their
partner
to
cut
off
the
power
so
that
they
can
storm
the
apart
with
the
help
of
infrar
goggl
.
Howev
,
their
partner
is
unsur
of
which
cabl
to
cut
.
He
is
undecid
.
This
happen
for
aboutsecond
.
The
audienc
find
some
humor
in
his
foolish
.
The
light
sudden
go
out
.
Cisco
is
surpris
and
say
:
``
Whoa
...
let
's
go
!
''
And
they
storm
the
apart
in
a
veri
nice
execut
sequenc
.
The
Big
Hit
of
the
titl
refer
to
a
kidnap
that
happen
a
quarter
of
the
way
through
the
film
.
Need
cash
,
Cisco
devis
a
plan
to
kidnap
the
daughter
-LRB-
China
Chow
-RRB-
of
wealthi
Japanes
industrialist
Jiro
Nishi
.
Howev
,
the
daughter
is
also
the
god-daught
of
Pari
-LRB-
Averi
Brook
-RRB-
,
who
is
Cisco
's
and
Melvin
's
boss
.
Infuriat
and
insuffer
,
Pari
command
Cisco
to
uncov
the
mastermind
of
the
kidnap
.
Dure
his
`
investig
'
,
Cisco
singl
out
Melvin
as
the
ringlead
,
and
Pari
order
his
captur
and
execut
.
Melvin
must
now
find
a
way
to
stay
aliv
.
By
the
way
,
do
you
know
how
the
investig
take
place
?
Cisco
's
partner
make
the
ransom
phone
call
believ
that
his
call
will
not
be
trace
becaus
of
a
Trace
Buster
that
prevent
trace
.
But
,
Mr.
Nishi
has
a
Trace
Buster
Buster
.
To
counter
that
,
Cisco
's
partner
has
a
Trace
Buster
Buster
Buster
.
But
Nishi
has
a
Trace
Buster
Buster
Buster
Buster
.
And
so
on
...
There
is
no
doubt
that
this
is
an
interest
world
in
which
they
live
.
And
there
are
lot
of
issu
that
we
'd
like
to
know
more
about
.
How
doe
Melvin
justifi
his
profess
to
his
fiance
?
What
goe
on
among
this
cliqu
?
Whi
is
Cisco
at
odd
with
Melvin
?
There
is
actual
a
lot
of
potenti
materi
that
could
have
been
explor
,
but
it
seem
that
no
effort
is
made
to
go
in
that
direct
,
and
instead
we
are
given
a
not-so-engross
plot
fill
with
one-lin
,
silli
sight
gag
,
extran
sub-plot
and
tomfooleri
.
And
,
I
have
n't
even
mention
his
finance
's
visit
parent
who
want
them
to
separ
,
nor
Melvin
's
mistress
,
nor
the
pimple-fac
video
clerk
demand
the
return
of
an
overdu
video
and
on
and
on
and
on
.
If
The
Big
Hit
signal
the
futur
of
Hong
Kong
style
movi
that
are
made
for
American
audienc
,
then
shoot
me
now
.
