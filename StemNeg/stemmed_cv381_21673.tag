For
a
movi
with
such
deep
religi
and
spiritu
underton
,
it
is
surpris
to
find
THE
MESSENGER
:
THE
STORi
OF
JOAN
OF
ARC
such
an
ungod
mess
.
In
the
earli
to
mid
1400
's
,
there
was
littl
in
the
way
of
spiritu
light
to
be
found
shine
from
the
heart
of
a
man
or
woman
.
The
church
was
a
dismal
dark
and
oppress
place
.
Franc
was
involv
in
``
The
Hundr
year
War
''
against
England
.
There
was
no
strong
polit
leadership
in
the
countri
.
Moral
was
low
,
there
be
littl
hope
for
the
futur
.
It
was
within
this
set
that
a
young
French
girl
began
hear
``
voic
''
and
see
``
vision
.
''
Convinc
that
these
were
messag
from
God
,
she
brazen
demand
to
see
the
dauphin
in
order
to
deliv
the
messag
direct
to
him
.
The
messag
:
If
he
would
give
her
an
armi
to
command
,
she
would
deliv
to
him
the
crown
.
He
doe
...
And
she
doe
.
Then
,
onc
seat
on
the
throne
,
he
abandon
her
to
her
English
captor
.

THE
FIFTH
ELEMENT
-RRB-
may
have
co-wrot
the
script
but
he
never
appear
to
have
a
proper
handl
on
the
materi
.
The
inconsist
of
the
cast
,
the
confus
blur
of
the
violent
battl
scene
,
the
inappropri
music
score
,
and
the
lack
of
a
vibrant
life
forc
at
the
center
of
the
film
add
up
to
a
larg
disappoint
end
product
which
is
oftentim
unintent
laughabl
.
His
biggest
miscu
was
to
cast
his
wife
,
Milla
Jovovich
-LRB-
THE
FIFTH
ELEMENT
-RRB-
in
the
titl
role
.
Ms.
Jovovich
,
look
spectacular
as
Joan
,
clad
in
battl
armor
,
astrid
a
similar
protect
hors
.
If
look
were
enough
to
fulli
convey
a
charact
,
she
would
have
been
brilliant
.
Sinc
it
is
n't
,
she
tri
-LRB-
and
fail
-RRB-
to
act
the
part
.
Her
Joan
is
unbalanc
,
``
inspir
''
the
troop
mere
by
scream
strident
and
wave
her
banner
or
sword
over
her
head
like
a
woman
possess
.
John
Malkovich
-LRB-
BEING
JOHN
MALKOVICH
-RRB-
fare
a
bit
better
as
the
dauphin
,
who
Joan
would
see
on
the
throne
as
Charl
VII
.
An
easili
manipul
man
,
his
weak
of
charact
foreshadow
the
betray
of
Joan
which
would
lead
to
her
death
.

-RRB-
give
a
strong
perform
in
minim
screen
time
as
the
dauphin
's
mother-in-law
and
chief
advisor
.
The
armi
under
Joan
's
command
are
compris
of
comic
figur
,
more
stoog
than
soldier
.
The
one
except
would
be
Tcheki
Karyo
-LRB-
LA
FEMME
NIKITA
-RRB-
as
Dunoi
,
the
man
who
was
lead
the
attack
prior
to

Tri
to

a

Dustin

SPHERE

has
a
small
inhuman
role
as
Joan
's
conscienc
which
begin
speak
to
her
while

Dress
like
cloak
monk
,
he
lead
her
to
doubt
herself
and
her
``
revel

''
As
well
she
should

Scriptur

speak
of

God

His
gift
of

abl
to

They
are
:

word

and

Even
the

themselv
are
a
result
of

His
``

the

point
to
a
devilish

than
a

While
her

she
