I
was
struck

Aside

that
it
's
a
mileston
in
anim
in
movi
-LRB-
it
's
the
first
film
to
combin
real
actor
and
cartoon
charact
,
have
them
interact
,
and
make
it
convinc
real
-RRB-
and
a
great
entertain
it
's
also
quit
an
effect
comedy/mysteri
.
While
the
plot
may
be
somewhat
familiar
the
charact

Maroon
think
that
Roger

wife
,
Jessica
's

possibl
unfaith
to
him
might
be
the
caus
of
distract
and
tell
