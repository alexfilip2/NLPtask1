The
first
imag
in
``
Final
Fantasi
:
The
Spirit
Within
''
is
a
computer-anim
close-up
of
a
human
eye
.
It
's
a
beauti
piec
of
work
,
remark
detail
and
quit
convinc
.
When
the
pictur
pull
back
to
reveal
the
owner
of
the
eye
,
howev
,
thing
chang
.
The
young
woman
has
mesmer
hair
,
although
it
hang
too
art
even
by
movi
standard
to
be
believ
.
The
facial
featur
are
more
detail
than
ani
computer-anim
seen
to
date
,
but
the
result
is
more
reminisc
of
a
veri
well-craft
doll
than
anyth
human
.
She
is
pretti
,
but
bland
,
and
not
near
express
enough
to
come
off
like
a
person
.
All
the
charact
in
``
Final
Fantasi
''
are
like
that
.
Of
the
core
group
,
the
younger
white
men
and
women
are
all
athlet
,
attract
and
indistinct
,
like
applic
for
a
TV
realiti
show
.
The
black
man
is
taller
and
burlier
,
and
the
age
scholar
is
bald
,
with
wrinkl
and
a
beard
.
None
of
them
appear
to
be
base
on
individu
;
they
all
look
like
the
product
of
general
descript
given
a
polic
sketch
artist
.
It
get
wors
when
they
talk
and
move
.
Whi
is
the
sarcast
voic
of
Steve
Buscemi
,
he
of
the
great
twist
face
and
snaggleteeth
,
come
out
of
the
mouth
of
some
dreari
Ken
doll
?
Whi
,
for
everi
fluid
physic
gestur
,
do
we
also
see
herky-jerki
puppet-styl
motion
?
More
to
the
point
,
who
decid
a
full-length
comput
anim
movi
featur
``
hyperR
''
-LRB-
their
term
,
not
mine
-RRB-
humanoid
was
a
good
idea
?
``
Final
Fantasi
''
is
base
on
a
phenomen
popular
video
game
I
ve
never
play
,
with
a
stori
straight
out
of
Japanes
anim
,
which
more
often
than
not
leav
me
bore
and
depress
.
If
you
re
a
fan
of
either
,
pleas
spare
me
your
letter
,
as
I
will
focus
sole
on
the
finish
film
and
not
it
sourc
materi
.
With
an
expression-challeng
cast
,
``
Final
Fantasi
''
mix
turgid
action
scene
with
heap
of
mystic
shit
.
The
result
is
ugli
,
confus
and
bore
.
Note
:
The
follow
reveal
the
basic
plot
.
If
you
want
to
have
a
fight
chanc
of
make
ani
sens
of
the
movi
,
I
suggest
you
read
it
.
Earth
is
at
war
with
alien
that
appear
to
feed
on
human
soul
.
Most
of
our
planet
is
devast
,
with
human
live
in
a
few
protect
citi
.
While
the
bulk
of
the
survivor
focus
on
militari
strategi
,
Aki
Ross
-LRB-
voic
by
Ming-Na
-RRB-
and
her
mentor
,
Dr.
Sid
-LRB-
Donald
Sutherland
-RRB-
,
believ
in
a
more
organ
approach
.
They
oper
on
the
notion
-LRB-
quot
straight
from
the
press
kit
-RRB-
``
that
all
life
form
have
signatur
spirit
wave
that
can
be
identifi
and
contain
.
''
Aki
and
Dr.
Sid
collect
a
seri
of
organ
specimen
whose
spirit
signatur
combin
will
form
a
wave
of
equal
and
opposit
intens
to
the
spirit
wave
of
the
alien
forc
.
The
wave
will
,
in
effect
,
cancel
each
other
out
and
disarm
the
foreign
contagion
.
They
have
collect
six
of
the
eight
key
spirit
need
to
complet
their
wave
.
They
are
on
a
desper
hunt
to
find
the
remain
two
spirit
befor
their
time
run
out
.
''
''
Are
you
still
with
me
?
There
's
onli
a
littl
more
.
Aki
is
infect
with
the
alien
forc
.
Dr.
Sid
has
develop
a
method
of
confin
the
contagion
and
keep
it
from
kill
her
,
but
the
defens
wall
wo
n't
hold
much
longer
.
Alreadi
,
the
alien
is
communic
with
Aki
through
her
dream
.
Aide
Aki
and
Dr.
Sid
are
the
Deep
Eye
,
a
group
of
hard-as-nail
type
that
would
have
felt
at
home
with
the
troop
in
``
Alien
.
''
Capt.
Gray
Edward
-LRB-
Alec
Baldwin
-RRB-
head
the
task
forc
that
consist
of
a
wise
guy
-LRB-
Buscemi
-RRB-
,
a
tough
woman
-LRB-
Peri
Gilpin
-RRB-
and
a
gentl
giant
-LRB-
Ving
Rhame
-RRB-
.
Throw
a
monkey
wrench
into
the
plan
is
the
requisit
dumb
ass
:
in
this
case
Gener
Hein
-LRB-
Jame
Wood
-RRB-
,
who
want
to
use
the
Zeus
Cannon
to
bomb
the
alien
back
to
the
Stone
Age
,
even
if
it
destroy
Earth
as
well
.
So
there
you
have
it
.
Like
most
of
the
anim
I
ve
seen
,
the
plot
combin
apocalypt
set
,
lot
of
shoot
and
fuzzi
spiritu
,
all
wrap
up
in
a
save-the-earth
bow
.
But
I
'm
bore
with
apocalypt
set
.
I
understand
whi
so
mani
live-act
film
employ
them
they
re
cheap
but
anim
film
can
show
anyth
,
so
whi
wallow
in
an
industri
trash
heap
?
The
action
scene
and
shoot-em-up
do
n't
satisfi
either
.
The
human
move
odd
and
their
facial
featur
are
so
mute
that
the
talent
voic
cast
ca
n't
bring
them
to
life
-LRB-
in
fact
,
their
effort
mere
emphas
what
we
re
miss
-RRB-
.
Aki
is
especi
disappoint
;
with
her
lack
of
express
and
flat
deliveri
,
she
look
and
sound
like
a
brunet
version
of
Weena
,
the
Eloi
girl
from
1960
's
``
The
Time
Machin
.
''
Drab
color
choic
and
alien
that
appear
to
have
been
creat
in
Jell-O
mold
sap
the
pizzazz
from
the
big
set
piec
.
Student
of
comput
anim
may
be
fascin
with
the
technolog
behind
``
Final
Fantasi
:
The
Spirit
Within
,
''
but
I
found
it
sub-par
across
the
board
.
``
Futurama
''
doe
more
effect
battl
visual
,
the
kid
in
``
South
Park
''
are
far
more
express
than
these
mannequin
and
ani
old
episod
of
the
contemporari
version
of
``
The
Outer
Limit
''
doe
better
doom
and
gloom
sci-fi
.
So
who
need
this
?
Not
me
.
