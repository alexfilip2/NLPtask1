A

,
_
The
Caveman
's
Valentin
_
is
a
feverish
tale
of
a
homeless
madman-cum-detect
who
,
on
the
morn
of
Februari
14th
,
discov
a
``
valentin
''
just
outsid
his
New
york
cave
:
one
of
Ella
Fitzgerald
's
strang
fruit
,
stuck
in
the
crotch
of
a
tree
--
a
young
male
model
murder
and
frozen
to
a
branch
.
Believ
at

that
his
imagin

shoot
evil
ray
into
his
mind
from
atop
the
Chrysler
Build
,
is
respons
for
the
murder
,
Romulus
-LRB-
Samuel
L.
Jackson
-RRB-
is
put
on
the
trail
of
an
avant-gard
photograph
in
the
Mapplethorp
mould
,
David
Leppenraub

Colm

His
minor
sleuth
interrupt
by
the
occasion
delusion
fit
and
bout
with
an
ecstasi
of
creation
-LRB-
Romulus
was
a
brilliant
Julliard-train
pianist
prior
to
his
psychosi
-RRB-
,
Romulus
uncov
clue
and
harass
suspect
on
his
way
to
convinc
his
police-woman
daughter
-LRB-
Aunjanu
Ellis
-RRB-
that
even

that

.
Everi
moment
an
exhaust
workshop
of
idea
,
and
everi
charact
the
same
,
_
The
Caveman
's
Valentin
_
is
a
concept
so
``
high
concept
''
that
it
sudden
becam
clear
to
me
that
the
film
fit
into
the
comic
book
genr
of
entertain
,
with
Romulus
's
``
Caveman
''
a
slight
more
mundan
version
of
Todd
McFarlan
's
urban
noir
hero
,
Spawn
.
With
a
long-vanish
wife
-LRB-
Tamara
Tuni
-RRB-
act
as
a
spiritu
guid
,
the
occasion
social
cast
commentari
,
the
secret
base
in
a
cave
,
a
diverg
genius
person
with
a
network
of
inform
and
support
,
and
a
wick
colour
arch-enemi
,
the
film
pile
on
the
lurid
comic
book
detail
and
dizzi
slapdash
colour
to
such
a
lavish
extent
that
I
was
vagu
surpris
that
the
blue
polic
car
were
n't
inscrib
with
``
Gotham
PD
.
''
That
be
said
,
_
The
Caveman
's
Valentin
_
can
onli
realli
succeed
as
a
heroic
fantasi
,
a
Frank
Miller
graphic
novel
that
has
the
audac
to
portray
the
blood
stain
a
field
of
virgin
snow
expand
to
form
the
shape
of
a
heart
.
The
difficulti
with
the
film
spring
from
the
misunderstand
that
it
somehow
adher
to
the
convent
of
a
thriller
or
a
polic
procedur
when
,
in
fact
,
_
The
Caveman
's
Valentin
_
is
a
superhero
fabl
that
take
on
the
caus
of
the
homeless
-LRB-
again
like
McFarlan
's
Spawn
-RRB-
while
attack
the
entrench
rule
class
in
govern
and
the
art
.
It
is
no
small
detail
that
our
hero
,
Romulus
,
is
not
onli
name
for
a
member
of
the
rule
class
who
live
his
life
-LRB-
in
legend
-RRB-
without
knowledg
of
his
royal
birth
,
but
also
that
our
Romulus
has
turn
his
back
on
the
comfort
of
the
literati
in
favour
of
a
mystic
exist
live
in
a
cave
in
a
park
.
In
the
Romulus
mytholog
,
sign
of
Romulus
'
royal
blood
is
brought
by
twelv
vultur
,
while
in
the
film
,
the
call
to
action
for
our
hero
come
in
the
form
of
not
the
carrion
bird
,
but
of
the
carrion
itself
.
Whether
or
not
Romulus
of
_
The
Caveman
's
Valentin
_
will
found
a
nation
,
or
,
in
the
case
of
novelist
Georg
Daw
Green
,
upon
whose
novel
his
own
screenplay
is
base
,
a
franchis
,
the
fact
remain
that
_
The
Caveman
's
Valentin
_
is
easili
the
most
misunderstood
film
of
2001
thus
far
.
It
,
along
with
M.
Night
Shyamalan
's
_
Unbreakabl
_
,
is
a
matur
cinemat
extrapol
of
the
graphic
novel
format
which
has
,
sinc
Miller
's
semin
``
The
Dark
Knight
Return
''
,
redefin
the
comic
medium
as
one
suitabl
for
matur
rumin
on
psycholog
sticki
topic
.
Reader
of
Sam
Keith
's
brilliant
``
The
Maxx
''
comic
seri
-LRB-
or
of
MTV
's
short-liv
anim
adapt
of
the
same
-RRB-
are
alreadi
familiar
with
the
idea
of
a
homeless
man
place
in
the
posit
of
knight
errant
and
king
of
his
own
twist
demesn
.
The
failur
of
both
``
The
Maxx
''
TV
show
and
of
_
The
Caveman
's
Valentin
_
-LRB-
not
forget
the
initi
backlash
against
_
Unbreakabl
_
-RRB-
suggest
that
the
public
may
not
be
readi
for
America
's
surpris
contribut

,
_
The

_
is
an
unremit
gorgeous
film
.
Kasi
Lemmon
,
follow
up
her
brilliant
1997
debut
,
_
Eve
's
Bayou
_
,
which
play
on
similar
theme
of
manufactur
realiti
and
mystic
,
fulfil
much
of
her
immens
promis
with
a
tale
of
seraph
and
lost
boy
,
artist
and
suffer
.
_
The
Caveman
's
Valentin
_
is
an
eleg
and
piquant
express
of
hope
for
justic
in
a
tilt
landscap
.
Clear
not
for
everi
tast
,
when
approach
with
the
correct
paradigm
,
it
is
one
of
the
most
stun
and
intens
fascin
film
of
the
year
:
a
redefinit
of
the
hero
archetyp
for
a
post-modern
audienc
with
urine-stain
wool
trench
coat
in
place
of
blue
tight
and
red
cape
.
_
The
Caveman
's
Valentin
_
is
a
fine
and
a
courag
film
,
crazi
enough
to
suggest
that
the
deliri
yammer
of
an
idiot
savant
is
the
best
and
truest
paladin
of
order
in
the
chao
of
Eliot
's
rat
's
alley
wasteland
