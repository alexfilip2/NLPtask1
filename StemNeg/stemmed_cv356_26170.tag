The
summer
of

was
n't
a
veri
good
one
for
devout
cinephil
.
It
offer
no
BLAIR
WITCHES
or
SIXTH
SENSES
;
the
best
big
budget
Hollywood
could
do
was
an
effici
X-MEN

and
a

NURSE

signal
the
unoffici
end
of
that
dread
summer
movi
season
and
the
commenc
of
a
potenti
brighter
fall
movi
season
,
that
battery-charg
-LRB-
at

for
critic
who
have
to
sit
through
everi

shit
that
mosey

time
of
year
when
all
those
Oscar

read
:
``

compet
for
audienc
.
Alas
BETTi
has
the
dubious
distinct
of
be
the
first
overprais
junk
heap
of
the
new
season
.
It
's
also
indi
director
Neil
LaBut
's
first
attempt
at
someth
resembl
a
mainstream
pictur
,
and
I
'm
sad
to
report
it
's
a
resound
failur
-LRB-
at
least
on
this
web
site
-RRB-
,
a
mess
that
's
as
hopeless
saccharin
as
peopl
have
accus
LaBut
's
previous
film
of
be
unrel
masochist
.
I
went
in
expect
someth
decent
,
for
BETTi
was
gleefulli
prais
,
it
's
screenplay
even
win
an
award
at
CANNES
,
but
I
exit
shake
my
noggin
in
bewilder
.
Are
critic
so
desper
for
someth
uniqu
that
they
re
blind
to
how
deriv
the
particular
brand
of
``

BETTi
doll
out
is
?
For
the
first
time
LaBut
is
work
from
a
script
he
has
not
written
,
and
he
seem
unsur
of
how
to
handl
the
materi
.
BETTi
tri
to
be
hip
like
PULP
FICTION
-LRB-
this
is
anoth

sever
allus

and
heartwarm
like

stick
in
your
favorit

-RSB-
,
but
by
the
end
it
left
me
cold
with
it
calcul
desper
.
It
's
LaBut
's
half
heart
attempt
to
make
a
crowd
pleaser
and
he
doe
n't
even
seem
to
have
half
that

Obviousli

at

could
use
a
dose
of
some
differ
kind
of
materi
befor
he
pigeon
hole
himself
further
,
but
NURSE
BETTi
is
n't
it
.
He
clear
has
littl
passion
for
what
he
's
do
here
,
instead
replac
his
mojo
with
strain
quirk
-LRB-
one
of
the
hit
men
is
a
huge
soap
fan
,
and
the
charact
of
Betti
would
be
littl
more
than
a
one
joke
gimmick
if
Zelllweg
had
n't
manag
to
transcend
that
-RRB-
tailor
made
to
appeal
to
the
widest
possibl
audienc
.
Near
everi
scene
between
Chris
Rock
and
Morgan
Freeman
fatal
slow
the
pictur
down
,
as
the
two
are
made
to
enact
soft-boil
Tarantino-esqu
dialogu
.
They
evinc
littl
chemistri
,
with
Rock
constant
in
over
the
top
rant
mode
,
act
more
like
an
angri
comic
than
ani
thing
resembl
a
hit
man
-LRB-
an
occup
that
's
repres
far
too
frequent
in
movi
nowaday
-RRB-
.
I
think
Rock
is
a
great
comic
yet
he
has
n't
been
abl
to
bring
his
feral
intellig
to
movi
,
whenev
he
act
,
and
no
matter
the
part
,
it
's
like
he
's
do
the
damn
CHRIS
ROCK
SHOW
.
Surpris
-LRB-
at
least
consid
her
work
in
ME
,
MySELF
AND
IRENE
-RRB-
Rene
Zellweg
give
a
revelatori
perform
,
build
on
her
babi
face
,
appl
pie
look
.
That
wide-open
face
and
helium
voic
earnest
suggest
a
littl
girl
not
fulli
grown
into
her
thirty-year-old
bodi
.
It
's
the
best
work
she
's
ever
done
.
Freeman
is
effect
as
alway
,
though
his
perform
nonetheless
suffer
becaus
it
seem
at
odd
with
where
the
movi
want
to
take
it
.
The
actor
play
the
role
in
his
usual
calm
,
collect
manner
,
though
the
flick
tri
to
insinu
a
symbol
kinship
between
his
charact
and
Betti
's
,
suggest
that
both
are
control
by
their
fantasi
rather
than
realiti
.
That
's
interest
but
the
movi
doe
n't
do
anyth
with
it
other
than
crash
land
the
sub-them
into
a
labor
speech
in
the
midst
of
a
bad
stage
gun
battl
.
The
film
has
good
moment
-LRB-
mani
of
the
scene
involv
a
veri
good
Greg
Kinnear
,
especi
his
confront
with
Zellweg
-RRB-
,
an
almost
sooth
,
lyric
score
-LRB-
and
you
know
a
movi
's
in
troubl
when
the
score
stick
out
as
one
of
the
best
thing
about
it
-RRB-
but
noth
jell
,
it
's
part
,
good
or
bad
,
are
so
dispar
as
to
be
oppos
.
The
film
might
have
work
had
it
settl
on
be
one
type
of
film
,
a
mainstream
,
femal
FORREST
GUMP
or
an
oddbal
art
film
,
but
as
both
if
it
fall
as
flat
as
Diet
Coke
.
BETTi
's
screenplay
make
the
mistak
of
reli
too
much
on
concurr
,
without
which
Betti
would
n't
make
ani
progress
in
the
film
.
NURSE
BETTi
is
a
film
driven
by
coincid
rather
than
charter
,
like
how
Betti
becom
a
nurs
in
the
film
,
a
job
that
she
take
in
order
to
get
closer
to
her
imaginari
lover
;
she
happen
to
be
at
the
hospit
at
the
exact
moment
that
a
drive
by
shoot
take
place
and
miracul
know
how
to
take
care
of
the
victim
's
wound
becaus
she
happen
to
see
how
on
TV
,
which
lead
to
her
be
offer
a
room
with
the
victim
's
girlfriend
who
eventu
get
Betti
into
a
parti
where
she
meet
Kinnear
a
littl
too
tidi
,
do
n'tcha
think
.
BETTi
has
an
interest
theme
,
though
it
doe
n't
even
seem
awar
of
this
.
The
current
state
of
TV
has
been
lean
toward
realiti
televis
what
with
the
enorm
success
of
SURVIVOR
and
moder
success
of
BIG
BROTHER
,
with
more
on
the
way
.
This
is
a
film
about
a
women
so
delud
as
to
think
that
her
favorit
soap
opera
is
realiti
-LRB-
iron
real-lif
SURVIVOR
Sean
Kennif
has
taken
a
part
as
a
doctor
on
the
soap
opera
GUIDING
LIGHT
-RRB-
.
Instead
of
explor
this
time
matter
in
a
way
relat
to
the
current
TV
craze
-LRB-
sinc
the
film
doe
larg
appear
to
be
a
satir
of
Televis
,
albeit
one
that
would
feel
more
appropri
in
the
80s
than
the
'
00s
-RRB-
,
the
film
simpli
use
Betti
's
delus
as
a
plot
devic
to
get
her
from
point
A
to
B.
No
progress
is
made
and
littl
is
unearth
except
that
mayb
LaBut
could
use
a
bit
of
rest
and
a
lot
of
contempl
.
