Jame
L.
Brook
,
one
of
the
develop
of
The
Simpson
and
director
of
Broadcast
New
,
return
to
the
big
screen
with
this
entertain
,
if
slight
flaw
comedi
.
Nicholson
play
Melvin
Udall
,
probabl
the
most
horribl
person
ever
on
the
screen
.
He
's
racist
,
homophob
,
and
never
has
a
good
word
to
say
to
anyon
.
So
,
nobodi
talk
to
him
,
except
waitress
Carol
Conelli
-LRB-
T.V
sitcom
star
Hunt
,
who
was
last
seen
in
Twister
,
1996
-RRB-
.
Natur
,
Udall
,
Conelli
and
gay
neighbor
Simon
Bishop
-LRB-
Kinnear
-RRB-
who
Nicholson
hate
,
all
hit
it
off
in
the
end
.
Like
Good
Will
Hunt
-LRB-
1997
-RRB-
and
Titan
-LRB-
1997
-RRB-
,
even
though
the
outcom
is
complet
obvious
,
As
Good
As
It
Get
is
an
enjoy
,
funni
and
warm
comedi
.
Nicholson
is
hilari
as
Melvin
,
churn
out
insult
with
superb
relish
.
Onli
Nicholson
could
get
away
with
the
line
that
Melvin
deliv
.
Hunt
is
also
good
as
waitress
Carol
,
and
easili
rise
to
the
challeng
of
Nicholson
.
There
's
also
-LRB-
thank
-RRB-
a
bit
of
chemistri
between
them
.
Kinnear
,
as
the
gay
neighbor
,
seem
to
have
a
slight
underwritten
role
,
he
's
more
of
a
plot
convienc
than
a
charact
.
Although
his
perform
is
good
,
his
charact
just
seem
to
exist
to
help
Melvin
and
Carol
come
togeth
.
In
fact
,
the
scene
stealer
is
Simon
's
dog
,
who
is
funnier
than
Nicholson
.
But
then
again
,
pet
are
alway
cute
on
screen
.
Provid
solid
support
is
Cuba
Good
,
Jnr
-LRB-
Jerri
Maguir
,
1996
-RRB-
and
yeard
Smith
-LRB-
who
is
the
voic
of
Lisa
Simpson
in
The
Simpson
-RRB-
Although
Good
is
n't
as
good
as
is
charact
in
Maguir
,
he
is
still
fun
.
He
overact
a
littl
,
but
not
so
much
as
to
be
annoy
.
Smith
is
also
good
,
although
she
has
a
fair
small
role
.
Even
director
Lawrenc
Kasdan
-LRB-
Bodi
Heat
,
1981
-RRB-
make
an
appear
as
a
doctor
.
But
this
is
primarili
Nicholson
film
,
and
everi
scene
he
's
in
,
he
's
steal
it
.
He
's
charact
is
so
hate
,
though
,
it
's
amaz
that
anyon
talk
to
him
at
all
,
especi
Carol
.
And
this
is
the
film
main
problem
.
It
's
total
unbeliev
that
Carol
would
ever
consid
like
Melvin
.
She
doe
n't
fall
in
love
with
him
natur
,
the
film
forc
her
to
fall
in
love
with
him
.
Also
,
Melvin
charact
seem
to
go
too
nice
,
too
quick
.
I
would
doubt
anyon
with
a
charact
like
Melvin
would
be
abl
to
turn
back
to
a
nice
,
love
person
.
It
would
take
a
helluva
long
time
,
much
longer
than
this
film
would
like
to
make
out
.
Brook
direct
is
good
,
though
,
if
a
bit
averag
,
but
he
usual
manag
to
get
an
emot
out
of
the
audienc
.
He
handl
the
comedi
scene
better
than
the
sentiment
one
-LRB-
he
tend
to
pile
on
to
much
schmaltz
-RRB-
but
general
he
's
good
.
There
's
also
a
nice
soundtrack
by
veteran
compos
Han
Zimmer
.
But
,
general
,
As
Good
As
It
Get
achiev
what
it
set
out
to
do
,
which
is
to
make
the
audienc
feel
good
by
the
end
of
the
movi
.
The
movi
is
a
bit
overlong
,
but
Nicholson
is
such
good
fun
that
the
run
time
pass
by
pretti
quick
.
Overal
,
As
Good
As
It
Get
is
a
fun
movi
,
even
though
it
may
be
unbeliv
,
and
certain
worth
see
-LRB-
if
just
for
Jack
Nicholson
perform
.
-RRB-
Not
quit
As
Good
As
It
Get
-LRB-
pardon
the
bad
joke
-RRB-
,
but
still
good
fun
.
