CAPSULE
:
Combin
one
quart
of
RAIDERS
OF
THE
LOST
ARK
,
a
dash
of
a
Jacki
Chan
movi
-LRB-
san
Jacki
-RRB-
,
two
teaspoon
of
gun-and
swordplay
,
and
a
dollop
of
CGI
.
Simmer
for
100
minut
.
yield
:
Zilch
.
THE
PHANTOM
is
a
depress
and
tire
retread
of
so
mani
earlier
,
better
movi
that
after
the
fifteen-minut
mark
I
start
catalogu
them
out
loud
.
It
's
hard
to
make
a
good
action-adventur
movi
that
doe
n't
simpli
recycl
it
predecessor
,
and
I
ve
seen
movi
that
even
at
least
did
the
recycl
grace
.
THE
PHANTOM
,
alleg
base
on
the
long-run
comic
of
the
same
name
,
doe
n't
even
bother
to
be
grace
.
It
's
a
stupid
and
incompet
movi
in
too
mani
way
to
list
,
but
I
ll
tri
.
The
film
open
up
with
a
``
prelud
''
sequenc
that
look
like
it
was
slash
to
ribbon
in
the
edit
and
then
given
a
Heavi
Voice-Ov
to
compens
for
whatev
got
thrown
out
.
We
go
from
there
to
a
jungl
sequenc
that
,
I
swear
to
God
,
recycl
the
truck-chas
scene
from
RAIDERS
OF
THE
LOST
ARK
note-for-not
,
possibl
even
shot-for-shot
,
right
down
to
the
moment
where
Indi
wrench
open
the
door
and
slung
one
of
the
driver
out
into
the
brush
--
AND
THEN
GOES
ON
TO
RIP
OFF
THE
ROPE-BRIDGE
SCENE
FROM
``
SORCERER
''
AS
WELL
!
SORCERER
,
as
you
may
well
rememb
,
was
a
remak
of
a
French
movi
,
THE
WAGES
OF
FEAR
,
in
which
a
bunch
of
lowlif
were
paid
pile
of
money
to
drive
a
truck
load
with
nitro
through
horribl
jungl
terrain
.
Both
version
of
that
movi
were
far
more
interest
than
this
flick
,
but
I
ve
got
my
job
to
do
,
so
back
to
the
salt
mine
we
go
.
Anyway
,
the
cinemat
theft
doe
n't
stop
there
.
Or
at
least
the
lack
of
inspir
.
There
is
n't
a
singl
thing
here
we
have
n't
seen
,
and
it
's
not
given
to
us
in
a
way
that
remot
evok
our
interest
.
We
have
-LRB-
where
's
my
list
?
-RRB-
a
Bad
Girl
,
a
Tough
Good
Girl
,
a
Secret
Cave
Hideaway
-LRB-
which
seem
inspir
more
by
DR.
NO
than
anyth
els
-RRB-
,
a
Boardroom
Meet
That
Drip
With
Greed
and
Venal
,
Magic
Artifact
of
Terribl
Power
,
and
Cary-Hiroyuki
Tagawa
wast
in
anoth
stupid
role
where
he
get
to
wear
a
Fu
Manchu
mustach
and
sneer
a
lot
and
general
humili
himself
.
What
els
is
there
?
The
plot
is
a
wast
of
time
.
The
set
altern
between
big
but
hokey
--
and
tini
and
still
hokey
.
There
are
line
in
the
script
that
are
just
beg
to
be
MST3Ked
--
and
I
'm
sure
onc
Mike
and
the
`
Bot
get
the
cash
,
they
ll
stick
it
on
their
sked
.
The
onli
thing
in
the
movi
worth
note
is
Billi
Zane
--
he
's
a
good
actor
,
and
he
tri
veri
hard
,
even
when
the
script
is
send
him
down
one
dead
alley
of
a
scene
after
anoth
.
All
I
can
say
is
that
I
pray
this
is
n't
the
begin
of
the
end
for
him
--
although
it
sure
look
like
the
final
nail
in
the
coffin
for
the
comic-book
super-hero
movi
.
