QUEST
FOR
CAMELOT
``
Quest
for
Camelot
''
is
Warner
Bros.
'
first
feature-length
,
fully-anim
attempt
to
steal
clout
from
Disney
's
cartoon
empir
,
but
the
mous
has
no
reason
to
be
worri
.
The
onli
other
recent
challeng
to
their
throne
was
last
fall
's
promis
,
if
flaw
,
20th
Centuri
Fox
product
``
Anastasia
,
''
but
Disney
's
``
Hercul
,
''
with
it
live
cast
and
color
palat
,
had
her
beat
hands-down
when
it
came
time
to
crown
1997
's
best
piec
of
anim
.
This
year
,
it
's
no
contest
,
as
``
Quest
for
Camelot
''
is
pretti
much
dead
on
arriv
.
Even
the
Magic
Kingdom
at
it
most
mediocr
--
that
'd
be
``
Pocahonta
''
for
those
of
you
keep
score
--
is
n't
near
as
dull
as
this
.
The
stori
revolv
around
the
adventur
of
free-spirit
Kayley
-LRB-
voic
by
Jessalyn
Gilsig
-RRB-
,
the
early-teen
daughter
of
a
belat
knight
from
King
Arthur
's
Round
Tabl
.
Kayley
's
onli
dream
is
to
follow
in
her
father
's
footstep
,
and
she
get
her
chanc
when
evil
warlord
Ruber
-LRB-
Gari
Oldman
-RRB-
,
an
ex-Round
Tabl
member-gone-bad
,
steal
Arthur
's
magic
sword
Excalibur
and
accident
lose
it
in
a
danger
,
booby-trap
forest
.
With
the
help
of
hunki
,
blind
timberland-dwel
Garrett
-LRB-
Carey
Elwes
-RRB-
and
a
two-head
dragon
-LRB-
Eric
Idle
and
Don
Rickl
-RRB-
that
's
alway
argu
with
itself
,
Kayley
just
might
be
abl
to
break
the
mediev
sexist
mold
and
prove
her
worth
as
a
fighter
on
Arthur
's
side
.
``
Quest
for
Camelot
''
is
miss
pure
showmanship
,
an
essenti
element
if
it
's
ever
expect
to
climb
to
the
high
rank
of
Disney
.
There
's
noth
here
that
differenti
``
Quest
''
from
someth
you
'd
see
on
ani
given
Saturday
morn
cartoon
--
subpar
anim
,
instant
forgett
song
,
poorly-integr
computer
footag
.
-LRB-
Compar
Kayley
and
Garrett
's
run-in
with
the
angri
ogr
to
Herc
's
battl
with
the
Hydra
.
I
rest
my
case
.
-RRB-
Even
the
charact
stink
--
none
of
them
are
remot
interest
,
so
much
that
the
film
becom
a
race
to
see
which
one
can
out-bland
the
other
.
In
the
end
,
it
's
a
tie
--
they
all
win
.
That
dragon
's
comedi
shtick
is
aw
cloy
,
but
at
least
it
show
sign
of
a
puls
.
At
least
fan
of
the
earli
-
90s
TGIF
televis
line-up
will
be
thrill
to
find
Jaleel
``
Urkel
''
White
and
Bronson
``
Balki
''
Pinchot
share
the
same
footag
.
A
few
scene
are
nice
realiz
-LRB-
though
I
'm
at
a
loss
to
recal
enough
to
be
specif
-RRB-
,
and
the
actor
provid
the
voic
talent
are
enthusiast
-LRB-
though
most
are
pair
up
with
singer
who
do
n't
sound
a
thing
like
them
for
their
big
music
moment
--
Jane
Seymour
and
Celin
Dion
???
-RRB-
.
But
one
must
strain
through
too
much
of
this
mess
to
find
the
good
.
Aside
from
the
fact
that
children
will
probabl
be
as
bore
watch
this
as
adult
,
``
Quest
for
Camelot
''
's
most
grievous
error
is
it
complet
lack
of
person
.
And
person
,
we
learn
from
this
mess
,
goe
a
veri
long
way
.
