Ironic
,
one
of
the
theme
of
200
Cigarett
is
that
you
should
tri
to
make
the
best
of
everi
moment
in
life
.
Unfortun
I
will
no
longer
be
abl
to
say
that
I
live
everi
moment
of
my
life
to
the
fullest
,
becaus
I
spent
95
otherwis
perfect
good
minut
,
watch
this
sad
excus
for
a
movi
.
Actualli
smoke
200
cigarett
in
the
sameminut
could
n't
be
ani
wors
for
you
than
it
is
to
watch
the
movi
.
Not
onli
is
it
a
pathet
bad
film
overal
,
but
200
Cigarett
actual
has
no
redeem
qualiti
whatsoev
.
The
plot
is
scatter
,
thin
and
predict
;
the
act
is
monument
bad
;
and
the
style
of
film
make
resembl
a
home
video
.
It
is
Decemb
31
,
1981
and
the
big
parti
is
at
Monica
's
-LRB-
Martha
Plimpton
-RRB-
hous
.
But
no
one
has
arriv
yet
.
Herinvit
guest
and
sever
peopl
that
they
have
pick
throughout
the
even
are
wander
the
street
of
New
york
Citi
in
various
group
.
Some
of
them
know
each
other
through
their
common
bond
of
have
slept
with
Monica
,
and
some
are
total
stranger
.
But
they
all
are
to
face
their
own
person
neuros
befor
night
's
end
.
Those
who
are
invit
are
the
one
that
have
the
issu
.
It
is
up
to
those
who
are
n't
to
help
them
come
to
term
.
First
there
is
Eric
-LRB-
Brian
McCardi
-RRB-
who
is
a
former
boyfriend
of
Monica
's
and
is
just
get
over
the
heartbreak
of
their
relationship
termin
prematur
becaus
of
his
sexual
perform
,
or
lack
thereof
.
He
is
one
of
the
most
bland
charact
,
in
a
film
full
of
dull
,
becaus
he
is
so
utter
predict
and
stereotyp
,
a
common
trait
of
this
poor
product
.
Bridget
-LRB-
Nicol
Parker
-RRB-
and
Caitlyn
-LRB-
Angela
Featherston
-RRB-
who
are
both
extrem
sensuous
young
women
look
for
someon
to
handl
their
desir
on
New
year
's
Eve
and
tag
along
to
the
parti
with
them
.
They
stumbl
across
a
nameless
bartend
-LRB-
Ben
Affleck
-RRB-
who
is
the
one
truli
perfect
charact
in
a
film
of
imperfect
.
He
is
nether
sexual
depriv
,
nor
uncertain
about
his
futur
,
as
he
is
in
law
school
.
His
lack
of
flaw
is
both
bore
,
unrealist
and
pain
to
watch
.
As
Bridget
and
Caitlyn
make
pass
at
him
you
are
neither
entertain
nor
humor
by
the
sub-standard
comedi
.
Move
on
,
there
is
Val
-LRB-
Christina
Ricci
-RRB-
and
Stephi
,
-LRB-
Gabbi
Hoffman
-RRB-
2
teenag
girl
with
fake
identif
and
veri
differ
thought
.
Val
is
Monica
's
cousin
and
a
true
fan
of
the
New
york
scene
.
On
the
other
hand
,
Stephi
is
convinc
that
she
is
vulner
to
crime
when
the
two
ventur
out
of
their
usual
locat
in
search
of
the
parti
that
they
just
ca
n't
find
.
Paradox
,
it
ispunk
that
they
meet
at
a
bar
-LRB-
actual
they
attempt
to
flee
from
their
presenc
,
but
are
n't
success
-RRB-
who
guid
them
through
their
fear
and
forc
a
level
of
relax
upon
their
warp
mind
.
Of
all
the
insan
dull
and
uninterest
coupl
,
onli
one
approach
a
level
of
decenc
in
both
act
and
plot
.
Wise
,
the
movi
's
creator
have
put
heavi
emphasi
on
Luci
-LRB-
Courtney
Love
-RRB-
and
Kevin
-LRB-
Paul
Rudd
-RRB-
who
are
best
friend
and
share
the
common
bond
of
be
dateless
.
Paul
has
just
broken
up
with
long
time
steadi
Ellie
-LRB-
Janean
Garofalo
-RRB-
and
is
start
to
come
to
term
with
his
loss
when
Luci
inform
him
that
Ellie
had
been
sleep
around
dure
their
relationship
.
Howev
,
the
onli
complex
to
these
two
charact
is
that
they
seem
to
want
to
be
more
than
friend
,
and
that
is
reiter
when
they
attempt
sexual
intercours
in
a
bathroom
stall
on
more
than
one
occas
dure
this
strang
even
.
Final
,
there
are
the
two
worst
perform
and
worst
sub-plot
of
the
film
.
Jack
-LRB-
Jay
Mohr
-RRB-
and
Cindi
-LRB-
Kate
Hudson
-RRB-
have
been
go
out
for
a
short
period
of
time
and
Jack
just
learn
that
he
took
Cindi
's
virgin
the
night
befor
.
While
she
attempt
to
play
this
down
and
be
her
usual
self
,
he
is
a
predict
self
loath
male
as
he
attempt
to
deal
with
a
string
of
one
night
stand
that
includ
the
recent
deflow
Cindi
.
Veri
often
,
when
a
film
is
as
putrid
as
this
product
,
there
will
at
least
be
a
decent
qualiti
of
film
make
to
reveal
an
occasion
moment
of
glori
.
Howev
,
this
film
has
neither
the
qualiti
of
cinematographi
nor
the
moment
of
glori
to
be
highlight
.
Instead
,
what
you
get
is
a
collect
of
rough
and
inconsist
cut
,
bad
continu
and
inaccuraci
.
First
,
and
most
notic
is
that
as
the
film
goe
from
one
subplot
to
anoth
,
there
is
no
appar
order
that
it
follow
,
and
it
is
also
weeken
by
unnecessarili
edgi
edit
from
scene
to
scene
and
shot
to
shot
.
At
other
time
,
object
seem
to
get
up
and
move
and
hairstyl
and
costum
chang
from
shot
to
shot
.
There
are
also
at
leastscen
in
a
taxi
cab
that
go
from
start
to
finish
.
Not
in
a
singl
one
of
them
doe
anybodi
pay
the
driver
.
And
yet
,
no
matter
how
miser
this
film
may
be
,
and
no
matter
how
poor
the
act
is
all
around
,
there
was
a
ray
of
a
hope
for
these
mani
bad
plot
.
Perhap
,
if
the
maker
had
just
decid
to
concentr
on
one
or
two
or
,
perhap
,
even
three
,
there
might
have
been
the
time
and
opportun
for
some
charact
develop
,
or
qualiti
act
,
or
even
a
decent
plot
payoff
at
the
end
.
But
it
did
n't
happen
that
way
.
The
cast
of
qualiti
name
actor
was
forc
into
role
that
not
even
one
of
them
could
convert
into
a
mediocr
perform
,
and
everi
stori
line
crash
and
burn
quicker
than
it
take
for
the
ball
to
drop
at
midnight
.
