commentari
from

the
best
we
ve

.
This
film
begin

unspecifi

.
In
the
aftermath
of
their

adventur
,
Buzz

voic

Tim
Allen
-RRB-
and
Woodi
-LRB-
voic

are
now
fast
friend
and
all
the
toy
live
in
perfect
harmoni
,
content
with
their
``
live
''
.
One
day
,
Andi
broke
Woodi
's
arm
off
,
while
play
with
him
.
Woodi
is
now
offici
discarg
and

where
he

Later

yard

,
and
she
collect
a
few
old
toy
from
her

Sinc
one
of

discard
is
a
member

rescu
,
leav
the
safeti
of
the
hous
for
the
uncertainti
of
the
front
lawn
in
order
to
bring
the
toy
back
.
Although
his
mission
is
success
,
he
is
place
in
a
serious
predica
when
a
toy
collector
name
Al
-LRB-
voic
of
Wayn
Knight
-RRB-

.
The
cowboy

need
to

seri
,
``

''
If
he
can
acquir
Woodi
,
Al
can
ship
everyth
to
a
toy

So

and
it
's
up
to
the
other
toy
,
led
by
Buzz
,
to
go
into
the
citi
to
save
their
friend
.
And
so
,
Buzz
,
Rex
-LRB-
voic
of
Wallac
Shawn
-RRB-
,
Hamm
-LRB-
voic
of
John
Ratzenberg
-RRB-
,
Mr.
Potatohead
-LRB-
voic
of
Don
Rickl
-RRB-
,
and
Slinki
-LRB-
voic
of
Jim
Varney
-RRB-
,
go
out
on
a
danger
journey
to
rescu
their
friend
,
they
find
themselv
confront
thing
like
busi
street
and
other
Buzz
Lightyear
toy
.
There
are
car
chase
,
gun
fight
and
final
the
confront
between
Buzz
and
his
Nemesi
-LRB-
who
,
by
the
way
,
resembl
Darth
Vader
-RRB-
.
Meanwhil
,
Woodi
learn
that
he
was
onc
a
TV
celebr
and
has
a
family-a
cowgirl
name
Jessi
-LRB-
voic
of
Joan
Cusack
-RRB-
,
a
hors
name
Bullsey
,
and
a
father
figur
call
the
Prospector
-LRB-
voic
of
Kelsey
Grammar
-RRB-
.
They
offer
him
anoth
life
,
as
a
celebr
--
a
toy
in
a
museum
in
Japan
.
He
is
now
forc
to
choos
between
be
love
intens
by
Andi
for
a
littl
while
-LRB-
befor
he
grow
up
-RRB-
and
be
forgotten
,
or
be
admir
by
children
for
generat
.
The
problem
is
,
if
Woodi
escap
from
Al
's
clutch
and
return
home
,
they
will
end
up
back
in
the
lone
dark
of
storag
.
A
real
effort
is
made
in
the
technic
depart
.
The
anim
is
rich
and
color
,
with
lot
of
wonder
detail
.
The
``
cinematographi
''
is
also
extrem
improv
sinc
Toy
Stori
;
there
are
a
lot
of
complic
swing
,
turn
and
close-up
that
realli
make
an
impress
.
Light
and
filter
are
use
to
creat
a
mood
-LRB-
as
in
a
surpris
emot
moment-Jessi
's
remembr
of
her
day
when
she
was
a
belov
toy
-RRB-
The
film
contain
a
lot
of
in-sid
joke
-LRB-
such
as
the
one
about
videogam
-RRB-
,
and
entertain
parodi
on
``
Jurass
Park
''
and
``
Star
War
''
.
The
film
end
with
the
``
fail
take
''
,
the
kind
of
scene
that
we
are
use
to
see
after
comedi
show
on
TV
.
These
outtak
are
some
of
the
funniest
scene
in
the
film
.
But
what
in
the
end
make
``
Toy
Stori
2
''
a
memor
experi
is
not
the
joke
,
it
multipl
parodi
or
marvel
anim
.
It
is
it
heart
and
emot
--
the
stori
about
the
mean
of
friendship
,
love
and
even
life
itself
.
It
is
not
difficult
to
predict
that
``
Toy
Stori
2
''
would
be
a
huge
econom
success
,
but
it
artist
achiev
was
unexpect
.
Unexpect
becaus
the
first
film
was
n't
much
more
than
a
demonstr
of
special
effect
.
But
most
it
was
unexpect
becaus
Disney
has
n't
produc
anyth
spectacular
in
year
and
is
constant
surpass
by
compani
such
as
DreamWork
and
Warner
Brs
.
But
here
the
director
has
chang
the
atmospher
of
the
film
,
make
it
more
access
and
interest
for
person
older
that
9
year
.
This
is
a
big
step-away
from
the
ancient
law
of
Disney-anim
.
Off
cours
,
this
is
not
``
Antz
''
,
it
is
not
as
intellig
;
this
is
not
a
landmark
and
no
masterpiec
,
but
I
promis
that
you
ll
find
it
as
funni
and
enjoy
as
I
have
.
Whether
this
is
the
best
anim
film
of
the
year
,
I
dare
not
say
.
My
choic
would
probabl
be
``
The
Iron
Giant
''
,
but
-LRB-
along
side
with
``
American
Pie
''
-RRB-
this
is
the
comedi
of
the
year
.
I
almost
lost
my
hope
for
Disney
,
but
``
Toy
Stori
2
''
prove
that
Disney
has
n't
lost
their
abil
to
entertain
.
