One
of
my
colleagu
was
surpris
when
I
told
her
I
was
will
to
see
BETSi
'S
WEDDING
.
And
she
was
shock
to
hear
that
I
actual
like
it
.
Her
reaction
was
understand
when
you
consid
that
the
film
revolv
around
Molli
Ringwald
,
who
has
n't
made
a
worthwhil
film
sinc
1986
.
But
the
fact
is
,
BETSi
'S
WEDDING
is
also
an
Alan
Alda
film
.
And
while
Ringwald
has
been
make
dud
for
the
last
four
year
,
Alda
has
been
involv
with
sever
noteworthi
project
,
includ
CRIMES
AND
MISDEMEANORS
and
A
NEW
LIFE
.
Written
and
direct
by
Alda
,
BETSi
'S
WEDDING
is
a
vibrant
slice-of-lif
,
mix
a
few
dramat
moment
into
a
big
bowl
of
whimsic
humor
.
Alda
's
comic
elixir
is
smooth
and
refresh
--
and
a
welcom
chang
of
pace
from
the
usual
summer
fare
.
As
bride
and
groom
,
Molli
Ringwald
and
Dylan
Walsh
are
the
pivot
charact
in
the
film
,
but
they
are
by
far
the
least
interest
.
Walsh
is
a
nonent
,
with
all
the
screen
presenc
of
a
door
knob
.
Ringwald
is
simpli
unbear
and
is
easili
the
weakest
link
in
the
chain
.
She
look
hideous
with
her
short-crop
orang
hair
,
red
lip-stick
and
grotesqu
outfit
.
She
's
suppos
to
be
a
dress
design
,
but
she
look
more
like
a
clown
.
And
to
make
matter
wors
,
Ringwald
's
perform
match
her
appear
.
Thank
,
Alda
keep
Ringwald
's
screen
time
to
a
minimum
;
he
is
far
more
interest
in
the
color
peripheri
charact
.
The
wed
is
just
a
devic
to
bring
togeth
the
bride
's
working-class
,
Italian
famili
and
the
groom
's
rich
,
gentil
famili
.
Ringwald
's
folk
are
homey
and
down-to-earth
,
with
Alda
as
her
free-spirit
father
,
Madelin
Kahn
as
her
practic
mother
,
and
Alli
Sheedi
as
her
lone
sister
.
Walsh
's
clan
,
on
the
other
hand
,
is
prim
,
proper
and
ostentati
.
When
the
two
famili
meet
and
mingl
,
the
movi
becom
a
stori
of
cultur
clash
,
or
as
one
charact
put
it
,
``
money
versus
valu
.
''
Alli
Sheedi
,
in
a
wonder
underst
perform
,
is
one
of
the
film
's
most
pleasant
surpris
.
Sheedi
express
more
with
just
her
eye
than
Ringwald
doe
with
her
entir
bodi
.
It
's
Anthoni
LaPaglia
,
howev
,
who
seiz
the
spotlight
.
LaPaglia
play
Stevi
Dee
,
a
suav
,
over
polit
mafioso
who
is
formal
court
Sheedi
with
old-fashion
chivalri
.
LaPaglia
's
sincer
but
dim-wit
charact
is
a
riot
.
And
what
's
uncanni
is
that
LaPaglia
is
a
dead
ringer
for
Robert
De
Niro
,
with
a
littl
bit
of
Alec
Baldwin
thrown
in
for
good
measur
.
LaPaglia
seem
to
have
attend
the
De
Niro
school
of
gangster
act
,
and
his
inspir
perform
is
part
a
tribut
to
his
role-model
and
part
a
rip-off
.
I
do
n't
know
whether
to
say
a
star
is
born
or
a
star
is
re-born
,
but
I
do
know
that
LaPaglia
's
over-the-top
perform
should
not
be
miss
.
The
scrumptious
comic
act
,
howev
,
extend
well
beyond
Sheedi
and
LaPaglia
.
Joe
Pesci
,
in
particular
,
sink
his
teeth
into
his
role
as
Alda
's
unscrupul
brother-in-law
,
a
slum
lord
with
mob
tie
,
who
is
cheat
on
his
wife
-LRB-
Catherin
O'Hara
-RRB-
.
Alda
,
face
with
challeng
of
both
direct
and
act
,
somehow
find
just
the
right
comic
touch
as
the
bride
's
financially-strap
father
,
a
carpent
whose
dream
are
bigger
than
his
wallet
.
The
film
adopt
Alda
's
psycholog
point
of
view
as
he
tri
to
one
:
plan
the
wed
,
and
two
:
pay
for
it
.
As
a
filmmak
,
Alda
's
style
of
humor
is
remark
restrain
and
tast
.
And
while
he
doe
n't
have
the
comic
genius
of
a
Woodi
Allen
,
Alda
doe
possess
the
inspir
to
make
movi
which
are
ten
time
more
entertain
than
the
slop
which
usual
pass
for
comedi
.
