Warrior
''
come
at
the
end
of
as
summer
where
we
ve
alreadi
experienc
man
eat
shark
-LRB-
``
Deep
Blue
Sea
''
-RRB-
,
man
eat
crocodil
-LRB-
``
Lake
Placid
''
-RRB-
and
even
a
man
hunt
witch
-LRB-
``
The
Blair
Witch
Project
''
-RRB-
.
Now
,
``
The
13th
Warrior
''
present
a
tribe
of
flesh
eat
men
who
believ
that
they
are
bear
.
The
stori
,
if
that
's
what
you
want
to
call
it
,
follow
Ahmed
Ibn
Fahdlan
-LRB-
Antonio
Bandera
-RRB-
an
Arabian
poet
who
fall
in
love
with
his
king
's
wife
and
is
banish
from
his
home
land
.
He
then
travel
to
the
land
of
the
Vike
and
becom
an
Ambassador
to
them
.
Eventual
the
Vike
are
call
upon
to
protect
the
peopl
of
the
villag
who
are
be
hunt
by
the
flesh
eat
men
.
Thirteen
warrior
are
chosen
to
go
on
the
mission
,
and
as
you
guess
it
,
Ahmed
is
chosen
as
the
thirteenth
.
He
's
not
a
warrior
,
and
at
first
not
well
accept
by
the
Vike
,
but
as
the
movi
advanc
he
ll
have
to
prove
himself
both
on
and
off
the
battlefield
.
That
's
basic
the
entir
plot
.
There
is
also
a
romant
subplot
that
has
been
so
bad
mishandl
and
,
one
assum
,
drastic
cut
that
you
begin
to
wonder
whi
the
filmmak
did
n't
just
edit
out
all
of
the
scene
attain
to
that
part
of
the
stori
.
Instead
they
chose
to
leav
just
enough
of
those
scene
in
to
annoy
the
viewer
.
The
film
is
basic
non-stop
action
and
when
it
paus
and
tri
to
develop
a
stori
it
becom
a
laugh
stock
.
The
battl
scene
,
although
well
choreograph
,
are
not
involv
and
not
the
least
bit
excit
.
We
do
n't
get
to
know
ani
of
the
charact
and
so
we
do
n't
care
who
live
and
who
die
.
The
film
,
which
want
to
be
Beowolf
,
come
across
more
as
a
fail
action-adventur
stori
aspir
to
epic
proport
but
not
achiev
it
on
ani
level
.
It
was
direct
by
John
McTiernan
who
's
,
``
The
Thoma
Crown
Affair
''
is
also
play
in
theater
current
.
And
it
's
not
that
McTiernan
work
simultan
on
both
film
but
that
,
``
The
13th
Warrior
''
was
place
on
the
shelf
for
so
long
with
the
studio
just
wait
for
a
time
to
dump
it
on
audienc
.
It
belong
back
on
the
shelf
.
