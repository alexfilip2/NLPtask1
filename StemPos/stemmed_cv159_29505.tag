With
his
last
two
films-Shin
and
Snow
Fall
on
Cedars-Australian
director
Scott
Hick
has
proven
his
cinemat
flashback
to
be
some
of
the
best
out
there
,
and
his
latest
,
Heart
in
Atlanti
,
is
no
differ
.
Its
structure-begin
and
end
in
present
day
with
one
long
flashback
in
the
middle-i
similar
to
The
Green
Mile
,
which
is
a
bit
iron
consid
both
were
base
on
Stephen
King
book
.
The
parallel
do
n't
end
there
,
either
.
Atlanti
was
adapt
by
William
Goldman
,
who
had
previous
pen
the
big-screen
version
of
Miseri
and
is
in
the
process
of
work
on
the
script
for
King
's
Dreamcatch
.
Even
the
film
's
content
is
a
bit
reminisc
of
Mile
.
In
fact
,
it
's
the
perfect
blend
of
the
feel-good
'
60s
nostalgia
of
Stand
By
Me
-LRB-
also
by
King
-RRB-
and
mystic
power
hokum
of
Mile
.
King
's
Atlanti
is
a
book
compris
of
five
relat
short
stori
,
but
the
main
focus
here
is
on
the
first
-LRB-
and
longest
-RRB-
tale
,
call
Low
Men
in
yellow
Coat
-LRB-
the
film
's
titl
come
from
the
second
chapter
-RRB-
.
It
's
set
in
1960
Harwich
,
Connecticut
,
where
11-year-old
Bobbi
Garfield
-LRB-
Anton
yelchin
-RRB-
live
in
a
board
hous
run
by
his
cold
,
self-cent
mother
Elizabeth
-LRB-
Hope
Davi
,
Joe
Gould
's
Secret
-RRB-
,
who
seem
to
care
more
about
her
wardrob
than
her
son
.
Bobbi
spend
his
time
with
his
two
closest
friend
,
John
Sullivan
-LRB-
Will
Rothhaar
-RRB-
and
tomboy
Carol
Gerber
-LRB-
Mika
Boorem
-RRB-
,
who
becom
someth
like
the
Kevin
,
Paul
and
Winni
of
Harwich
.
When
a
new
tenant
move
into
the
vacant
room
,
the
fatherless
Bobbi
find
a
male
role
model
in
Ted
Brautigan
-LRB-
Anthoni
Hopkin
,
Hannib
-RRB-
,
a
mysteri
stranger
who
is
vagu
enough
about
his
past
to
make
Bobbi
's
mom
suspici
enough
to
at
least
momentarili
turn
her
head
away
from
the
mirror
.
Ted
teach
his
young
neighbor
about
the
wonder
of
literatur
-LRB-
after
his
cheapskat
mother
give
him
a
librari
card
for
his
birthday
-RRB-
,
dispens
prophet
word
of
wisdom
and
even
pay
Bobbi
one
dollar
a
week
to
read
him
the
local
newspap
and
keep
his
eye
peel
for
the
Low
Men
,
a
group
of
peopl
chase
Ted
to
exploit
his
special
power
.
I
wo
n't
go
into
what
these
power
are
,
but
they
re
consider
tone
down
from
the
book
-LRB-
and
do
n't
involv
black
stuff
fli
out
of
Ted
's
mouth
,
a
la
Mile
-RRB-
.
Atlanti
'
present-day
set
which
bookend
the
film
is
base
on
the
novel
's
final
chapter
,
titl
Heaven
Shade
of
Night
Are
Fall
,
and
featur
David
Mors
-LRB-
in
yet
anoth
connect
to
The
Green
Mile
-RRB-
as
a
marri
,
middle-ag
Bobbi
who
learn
of
the
death
of
both
of
his
childhood
friend
and
return
to
the
dilapid
board
hous
in
which
he
spent
his
format
year
.
Atlanti
is
nowher
near
as
flashi
as
Hick
'
Cedar
,
which
is
disappoint
but
understand
consid
the
switch
from
the
complet
amaz
Robert
Richardson
to
the
occasion
amaz
Piotr
Sobocinski
,
the
Oscar-nomin
cinematograph
behind
Krzysztof
Kieslowski
's
Red
.
The
act
is
solid
from
everyon
,
includ
Hopkin
,
who
never
onc
make
you
think
of
Dr.
Lecter
.
Most
impress
are
youngster
yelchin
and
Boorem
,
who
both
had
tini
part
in
Along
Came
a
Spider
.
While
I
did
n't
realli
have
much
of
a
problem
with
Goldman
's
screenplay
,
I
do
need
to
point
out
at
least
one
inconsist
.
Goldman
,
for
those
of
you
who
do
n't
read
Premier
,
write
what
seem
like
an
annual
critic
of
everybodi
els
's
film
,
care
explain
whi
they
all
suck
,
make
no
sens
and
insult
their
audienc
,
while
somehow
fail
to
mention
the
crap
that
he
's
pen
-LRB-
like
The
Gener
's
Daughter
-RRB-
.
It
's
mean-spirit
but
fun
to
read
,
most
on
account
of
nobodi
els
in
Hollywood
have
the
ball
to
say
anyth
remot
negat
about
anybodi
els
in
the
busi
-LRB-
includ
Michael
Jackson
,
O.J.
and
Robert
Blake
-RRB-
.
In
Atlanti
,
which
is
suppos
to
be
told
through
the
eye
of
young
Bobbi
,
one
would
assum
he
would
have
to
be
in
each
scene
in
order
to
have
the
memori
to
which
to
flash
back
.
Well
,
he
's
not
,
and
it
doe
n't
make
sens
.
