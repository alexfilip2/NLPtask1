Sometim
you
just
get
more
than
your
bargain
for
...
like
when
Boston-bas
Hazmat
Elimin
,
run
by
Scottish
actor
Peter
Mullan
and
his
trusti
assist
,
David
Caruso
,
assur
a
town
engin
-LRB-
Paul
Guilifoyl
-RRB-
that
they
can
remov
insidi
asbesto
fiber
from
a
Victorian
hospit
facil
in
a
week
.
Erect
in
1871
,
desert
and
decompos
sinc
1985
,
the
Danver
Mental
Hospit
,
is
one
of
the
most
malevol
``
locat
''
ever
chosen
for
a
film
.
The
structur
is
so
massive-with
it
labyrinth
of
rubble-strewn
corridor
,
collaps
floor
,
stagnant
pool
of
water
,
isol
cell
,
and
omin
surgic
chamber
where
experiment
pre-front
lobotomi
were
performed-that
their
task
seem
imposs
within
that
time
frame
.
And
each
member
of
their
inexperienc
crew
-LRB-
Stephan
Gevedon
,
Brandon
Sexton
III
,
and
Josh
Luca
-RRB-
is
cope
with
his
own
person
demon
as
,
one
by
one
,
their
mind
seem
to
be
affect
by
the
grim
area
in
which
they
re
work
.
The
film
's
titl
is
deriv
from
salvag
reel-to-reel
audio-record
session
involv
the
demon
possess
of
a
young
woman
who
is
suffer
from
multipl
person
.
By
the
time
Session
9
occur
so
do
dread
disast
.
Filmmak
Brad
Anderson
obvious
envis
this
as
a
gruesom
chainsaw-massacre-typ
ghost
stori
but
the
script
lack
structur
and
is
n't
particular
scari
.
The
conclus
is
more
ludicr
than
convinc
.
Silli
me
...
at
first
,
I
thought
that
the
origin
name
of
the
Danver
Lunat
Asylum
bore
some
refer
to
Mrs.
Danver
,
the
creepi
housekeep
play
by
Judith
Anderson
in
Alfred
Hitchcock
's
truli
terrifi
``
Rebecca
''
that
also
involv
a
cavern
mansion
call
Manderley
.
