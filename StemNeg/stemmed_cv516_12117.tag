Share

give

's
most

all
becaus
he
ran

brazen
red
hairdo
that
set
this
one
apart
from
the
myriad
of
similar
film
.
A
movi
this
bad
speak
for
itself
.
What
's
left
to
say
when
everi
element
the
movi
possess
is
a
shame
retread
of
movi
past
?
The
script
is
100
%
recycl
,
the
direct
is
hokey
,
and
the
act
is
absolut
horribl
.
It
is
onli
Thorne-Smith
who
seem
to
take
her
job
serious
,
an
accomplish
which
sure
deserv
the
medal
of
honor
.
She
certain
went
beyond
