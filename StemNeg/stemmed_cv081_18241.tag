again
,
but
this
time
detect
,
who
had
to
catch
vicious
serial

in
his
veri

,
doe
n't
want
to

serial

,
and
evid
indic
connect
with
one
of
Dietz
's
old
case
.
To
make
thing
even
more
interest
,
it
seem
that
the
killer
deliber
stage
murder
in
order
to
bring
Dietz
to
the
investig
.
Fan
of
the
British
TV
film
and
mini-seri
like
PRIME
SUSPECT
or
CRACKER
would
probabl
see
a
lot
of
similar
RELENTLESS
seri
of
movi
.
They
both
featur
vicious
psychopath
killer
,
yet
also
give
a
lot
of
,
usual
depress
,
detail
about
chief
investig
's
privat
live
.
This
one
is
n't
an
except
,
but
similar
with
British
televis
are
onli
in
content
.
The
execut
and
style
is
differ
,
which
make
this
film
mediocr
piec
of
entertain
at
best
.
Useless
,
gratuit
erotica
also
doe
n't
help
either
,
obvious
make
this
film
longer
than
it
should
be
.
The
actor
are
good
,
though-Leo
Rossi
is
fine
as
usual
,
and
William
Forsyth
play
one
of
more
compel
villain
in
his
career
.
Signi
Coleman
as
Dietz
's
love
interest
,
is
,
on
the
other
hand
,
quit
miscast
.
But
she
wo
n't
have
to
worri
about
it
in
the
futur
career
,
sinc
RELENTLESS
3
was
n't
suppos
to
be
anybodi
's
finest
moment
anyway
.
