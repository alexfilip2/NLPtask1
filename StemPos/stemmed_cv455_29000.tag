Jackson

to
a

report
on

when

paint
Jackson
Pollock
's
``
make
love
''
quot
is
famous
,
but
in
practic
the
same
breath
,
he
said
a
more
construct
thing
,
``
It
's
like
look
at
a
bed
of
flower
--
tear
your
hair
out
over
what
it
mean
.
''
It
took
him
sixteen
word
to
do
as
whole
dissert
have
tri
and
fail
:
equat
God
and
abstract
art
and
offer
a
kind
of
backhand
comfort
to
those
confus
to
the
point
of
resent
by
the
concept
.
The
biopic
_
Pollock
_
,
actor
Ed
Harri
'
directori
debut
,
reflect
the
second
soundbit
in
how
it
accept
Pollock
's
creation
as
part
of
the
order
of
thing
,
and
should
similar
disarm
hater
of
fine
art
.
Arguabli
more
than
ani
other
live
actor
,
Harri
,
who
also
play
_
Pollock
_
,
embodi
the
archetyp
Work
Stiff
,
and
his
blue-collar
demystif
of
Pollock
's
labour-intens
art
,
both
as
perform
and
director
,
make
for
unpretenti
cinema
.
-LRB-
From
what
I
know
of
Harri
,
he
,
like
Pollock
,
was
not
born
gift
or
lucki
;
instead
,
a
strong
work
ethic
is
the
seed
of
his
success
.
-RRB-
Grant
,
it
's
possibl
that
_
Pollock
_
will
alien
those
same
viewer
perplex
by
the
imponder
``
purpos
''
of
Pollock
's
splatter
seri
:
the
common
thread
between
them
is
a
lack
of
editori
.
The
movi
_
Pollock
_
is
all
purpos
gaze
and
silent
exchang
dot
by
tantrum
,
but
the
motiv
are
left
to
our
own
percept
.
And
it
is
a
sympathet
yet
not
altogeth
forgiv
film
,
as
illustr
by
a
dishearten
conclus
.
_
Pollock

encapsul
the
period
in
which
he
fought
a
lose
battl
against
person

,

the

A
brief
introduct
to
Pollock
's
rage
drunk
side
segu
into
his
get
accost
by
a
fellow
New

artist
,
Lee
Krasner
-LRB-
Marcia
Gay
Harden
,
award
a
Best
Support
Actress
Oscar
for
this
brilliant
portray
-RRB-
,
who
work
from
the
outside-in
,
pre-intellectu
everi
stroke
of
her
brush
.
In
a
scene
after
they
have
move
in
togeth
and
establish
adjoin
studio
,
she
ask
what
he
hope
to
achiev
on
his
latest
canva
,
grill
him
about
the
interplay
of
cubism
and
surreal
until
he
say
,
``
you
paint
the
fuck
thing
,
''
and
leav
in
a
huff
.
By
the
time
they
wed
,
she
has
becom
his
de
facto
manag
;
it
is
form
marri
function
and
chao
marri
disciplin
,
a
most
harmoni
collis
.
-LRB-
Krasner
deni
him
a
babi
,
indic
that
it
would
upset
the
balanc
.
-RRB-
Such
a
union
is
destin
to
implod
,
and
I
hope
I
'm
not
ruin
the
_
Pollock
_
experi
by
say
that
it
doe
.
While
it
is
never
depict
as
a
veri
romant
matrimoni
to
start
--
Pollock
and
wife
channel
their
passion
elsewher
--
their
symbiosi
leav
each
other
pick
dri
after
sever
year
,
and
it
come
down
to
Krasner
suffer
one
of
Pollock
's
connipt
too
mani
:
``
you
are
kill
me
!
''
you
are
kill
me
!
you
are
kill
me

Aside
:
Harri
'
own
wife
,
Ami
Madigan
,
is
unrecogniz
and
except
as
galleri
diva
Peggi
Guggenheim
.
-RRB-
Pollock
himself
move
on
to
dallianc
with
younger
women
like
Ruth
Klingman
-LRB-
the
scorch
Jennif
Connelli
-RRB-
,
hope
,
one
suppos
,
to
catch
the
revit
whiff
of
youth
.
I
love
Jackson
Pollock
's
stuff
and
I
am
enamour
of
Harri
'
_
Pollock
_
as
well
.
It
's
scrappi
and
observ
;
no
coincid
that
it
minor
fail
are
the
occasion
invas
flourish
,
such
as
Jeff
Beal
's
hummabl
but
no
less
lament
score
--
I
ca
n't
imagin
that
Pollock
,
or
anyon
,
would
paint
to
this
music
,
which
put
fill
soundtrack
void
ahead
of
complement
the
imag
.
One
of
my
favourit
sequenc
is
an
eerili
quiet
re-enact
of
Han
Namuth
shoot
that
famous
Pollock
footag
in
East
Hampton
,
Long
Island
;
the
mount
tension
is
almost
comic
,
as
Namuth
keep
interrupt
Pollock
's
process
to
reload
his
camera
or
take
a
dinner
break
.
A
more
season
director
might
ve
been
too
arrog
to
admit
that
not
all
artist
or
medium
are
creat
equal
.
