''
doe
.
Far
too
mani
of
them
end
up
re-hash
the

Is
it

wonder
that

Thank
,
``
Toy
Stori
2
''
is
a
wonder
except
.
I
ca
n't
rememb
the
last
time
I
saw
a
sequel
as
consist
fun
and
invent
as
this
one
.
It
's
yet
anoth
sign
that
Pixar
,
the
acclaim
anim
studio
behind
``
Toy
Stori
''
and
``
A
Bug
's
Life
,
''
is
still
at
the
top
of
it
game
.
Woodi
and
Buzz
are
back
in
the
sequel
to
the
1995
hit
``
Toy
Stori
,
''
and
thing
have
chang
a
bit
sinc
the
last
one
end
.
Woodi
-LRB-
voic
by
Tom
Hank
-RRB-
is
prepar
to
leav
with
his
owner
Andi
for
cowboy
camp
.
In
his
absenc
,
he
has
assign
Buzz
Lightyear
-LRB-
Tim
Allen
-RRB-
,
now
comfort
in
his
role
as
a
toy
,
to
take
charg
.
Unfortun
,
Woodi
's
trip
is
ruin
when
he
is
accident
put
into
the
famili
garag
sale
,
and
is
stolen
by
an
over-zeal
toy
collector
-LRB-
Wayn
Knight
-RRB-
.
Off
to
save
him
are
Buzz
and
member
of
the
old
``
toy
gang
,
''
includ
Mr.
Potato
Head
-LRB-
Don
Rickl
-RRB-
,
Rex
the
nervous
dinosaur
-LRB-
Wallac
Shawn
-RRB-
,
Hamm
the
piggi
bank
-LRB-
John
Ratzenberg
-RRB-
,
and
Slinki
Dog
-LRB-
Jim
Varney
-RRB-
.
While
in
captiv
,
Woodi
make
a
startl
discoveri
:
he
is
actual
part
of
a
collect
of
toy
base
on
a
1950
's
children
's
show
entitl
``
Woodi
's
Roundup
.
''
He
meet
the
show
's
other
charact
,
which
includ
Jess
-LRB-
Joan
Cusack
-RRB-
,
his
cowgirl
sidekick
,
the
wise
old
Prospector
-LRB-
Kelsey
Grammer
-RRB-
,
and
Bullsey
,
his
trusti
hors
.
They
have
all
been
anxious
await
Woodi
's
arriv
,
as
onc
their
set
is
complet
,
they
will
be
sold
to
a
Japanes
toy
museum
,
and
final
escap
storag
forev
.
This
mean
Woodi
now
face
a
difficult
choic
.
With
his
friend
come
to
rescu
him
,
doe
he
go
with
them
and
spend
a
few
more
year
with
Andi
,
or
doe
he
go
to
Japan
and
be
immort
forev
?
As
in
the
origin
film
,
``
Toy
Stori
2
''
contain
first-rat
anim
,
and
Pixar
Studio
has
done
a
remark
job
improv
on
the
impress
work
they
did
there
.
Report
,
the
film
was
origin
slate
for
a
direct-to-video
releas
,
but
after
see
the
improv
that
had
been
made
,
Disney
right
decid
to
releas
it
into
theater
.
The
film
is
well
worth
see
on
the
big
screen
.
The
color
are
bright
,
the
textur
sharp
,
and
even
the
human
charact
look
more
``
human
.
''
The
anim
is
consist
seamless
,
with
the
action
fast
and
furious
and
the
facial
express
believ
.
There
are
so
mani
impress
sequenc
that
I
'd
find
it
imposs
to
list
them
here
,
but
I
was
particular
wow
by
a
scene
where
Buzz
and
his
cohort
must
get
across
a
busi
intersect
to
get
to
Al
'
s
Toy
Barn
,
the
store
own
by
Woodi
's
captor
.
Pixar
's
rendit
of
the
famili
dog
is
also
nice
done
,
with
fur
so
realist
you
almost
feel
you
could
reach
out
and
touch
it
.
The
voic
work
is
also
perfect
complementari
,
and
as
with
the
first
movi
,
doe
much
to
help
further
charact
develop
.
Tom
Hank
and
Tim
Allen
again
disappear
into
their
role
as
Woodi
and
Buzz
,
make
you
forget
who
is
do
the
voic
.
It
was
Woodi
and
Buzz
up
there
,
not
Tom
and
Tim
.
All
the
cast
member
from
the
origin
repris
their
role
,
and
each
is
excel
.
Sever
new
voic
have
been
ad
,
with
Joan
Cusack
,
Kelsey
Grammer
,
and
Wayn
Knight
do
fine
work
.
``
Toy
Stori
2
''
is
strong
in
character
,
and
is
abl
to
expand
on
what
we
saw
in
the
first
movi
.
Woodi
face
difficult
choic
,
while
Buzz
is
confront
with
a
new
Buzz
who
has
n't
yet
realiz
his
status
as
a
toy
,
forc
him
to
see
what
he
use
to
be
like
.
The
new
charact
are
also
develop
quit
well
,
especi
Jess
,
who
narrat
a
Sarah
McLachlan-aid
flashback
illustr
how
she
was
love
,
then
forgotten
by
her
owner
.
It
may
be
computer-anim
,
and
it
may
have
sappi
music
,
but
it
's
downright
touch
.
The
script
,
despit
have
a
stori
and
screenplay
each
credit
to
four
differ
writer
,
is
endless
clever
and
invent
,
especi
consid
that
it
's
a
sequel
.
The
reason
``
Toy
Stori
2
''
work
where
other
movi
sequel
fail
is
that
it
refus
to
just
capit
on
the
origin
's
success
by
re-do
the
same
stori
and
use
the
same
charact
.
Not
this
one
.
We
get
charact
chang
,
new
charact
,
and
new
issu
brought
up
.
``
Toy
Stori
2
''
is
also
remark
for
the
way
in
which
it
keep
reinvent
itself
.
There
is
alway
anoth
clever
idea
wait
just
around
the
corner
here
.
The
humor
is
sharp
and
witti
,
with
someth
to
amus
both
kid
and
adult
.
There
are
funni
asid
to
film
such
as
``
Star
War
''
and
``
Jurass
Park
,
''
among
other
,
new
take
on
classic
toy
like
Barbi
and
Rock
'
Em
Sock
'
Em
Robot
,
and
appear
from
other
Pixar
effort
``
A
Bug
's
Life
''
and
the
1997
short
``
Geri
's
Game
.
''
-LRB-
Geri
himself
make
an
appear
as
a
toy
repairman
who
fix
Woodi
's
broken
arm
.
-RRB-
The
action
is
fast
and
furious
,
and
the
chase
-LRB-
in
the
street
,
in
a
toy
store
,
in
an
elev
,
on
a
baggag
carousel
,
and
in
an
airplan
-RRB-
keep
get
bigger
and
better
.
``
Toy
Stori
2
''
never
grow
stagnant
,
becaus
there
is
alway
someth
new
to
hold
your
interest
.
The
more
you
pay
attent
to
it
,
the
more
reward
it
is
.
It
's
rare
to
see
a
film
like
``
Toy
Stori
2
''
come
along
,
becaus
it
's
the
kind
of
film
that
's
almost
imposs
to
dislik
.
It
's
creat
pure
to
entertain
,
and
though
I
enjoy
a
thought-provok
drama
as
much
as
the
next
person
,
it
's
nice
to
see
that
film
are
still
tri
to
do
exact
what
movi
first
tri
to
do
:
send
us
out
with
a
smile
.
It
's
a
fair
bet
that
the
whole
famili
will
have
smile
on
their
collect
face
after
see
``
Toy
Stori
2
.
''
It
's
the
rare
sequel
that
manag
to
expand
on
,
and
live
up
to
,
the
origin
.
