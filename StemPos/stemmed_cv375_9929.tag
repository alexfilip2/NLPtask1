There
's
a
moment
in
Schindler
's
List
when
a
number
of
jew
are
trudg
through
snow
,
clean
and
crisp
,
dark
edg
and
frost
on
the
ground
.
One
girl
waltz
through
,
wear
a
red
dress
that
sting
the
eye
.
It
is
probabl
the
finest
moment
through
out
the
film
.
When
I
first
saw
it
I
began
to
cri
,
though
I
could
not
say
whi
.
This
landscap
is
the
set
of
mani
small
moment
that
add
up
to
one
big
whole
.
when
one
man
is
shot
in
the
head
we
see
blood
ooz
out
onto
the
ground
--
so
black
and
murki
,
it
almost
pomegran
red
.
At
anoth
time
we
follow
a
young
boy
as
he
run
,
search
for
a
hide
spot
befor
final
squeez
into
a
toilet
--
which
is
alreadi
occupi
.
Like
so

Kane
,

,
The
Godfath
,
The
Godfath
Part
II
,
Greed
,
-RRB-
mani
of
the
greatest
American
film
,
Schindler
's
List
play
with
the
concept
of
money
,
power
,
and
soul
.
But
this
is
a
movi
about
a
man
who
doe
the
right
thing
.
Stark
emot
,
and
brutal
power
,
Schindler
's
List
strip
away
everyth
on
the
outset
and
leav
us
oni
feel
.
The
follow
that
it
has
gain
is
not
supris
--
this
is
probabl
,
thus
far
,
the
best
film
of
the
decad
.
Steven
Spielberg
has
alway
been
a
skilful
filmmak
--
his
assur
hand
churn
out
both
Jurass
Park
,
Jaw
,
the
Indiana
Jone
film
,
and
E.T.
--
but
it
was
n't
until
1993
that
we
saw
what
a
brilliant
man
he
can
be
.
The
product
of
his
genui
is
realli
someth
to
see
--
it
can
bring
tear
to
your
eye
just
as
it
uplift
you
.
Throughout
,
we
sens
the
deep
control
which
he
so
master
spread
.
We
watch
Oskar
Schindler
-LRB-
Liam
Neeson
-RRB-
grow
from
an
arrog
,
self
import
man
who
hire
Jew
onli
to
save
money
into
a
move
figur
,
with
a
deep
sens
of
pride
and
accomplish
.
The
film
requir
much
work
,
and
can
be
a
harrow
experi
--
go
expect
a
quick
entertain
and
you
ll
be
bitter
dissapoint
.
It
doe
reward
the
patient
viewer
.
This
is
a
matur
Spielberg
,
and
his
deft
hand
shape
an
absolout
masterpiec
.
This
eqsuisit
,
beauti
film
is
a
rare
gem
.
It
doe
a
good
job
of
summar
whi
I
love
movi
.
It
leav
one
breathless
,
uplift
,
and
with
much
to
think
about
.
Afterward
you
can
reflect
on
individu
imag
,
vision
,
and
peopl
.
Lacon
,
remov
,
Schindler
stride
through
the
film
a
detach
prescenc
who
watch
all
,
doe
much
,
and
leav
feel
as
if
he
could
,
should
,
have
done
more
then
he
did
and
was
abl
to
.
The
chang
seem
natur
--
in
the
hand
of
a
lesser
filmmak
,
it
would
be
crude
and
would
cheat
the
audienc
.
Instead
we
are
told
a
tale
,
told
a
stori
.
The
film
is
punish
to
watch
,
yes
.
But
anyon
who
allow
themselv
to
get
involv
will
experi
a
miracl
,
and
a
genuin
masterpiec
of
a
movi
.
