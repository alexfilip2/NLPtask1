I
rememb
make
a
pact
,
right
after
`
Patch
Adam
'
,
to
not
be
easili
be
sucker
by
movi
drip
with
sentiment
.
But
darn
it
,
`
Music
of
the
Heart
'
is
just
layer
with
feel-good
materi
and
bright
character
.
It
's
hard
to
dislik
a
movi
that
use
such
skill
with
it
's
manipul
.
In
addit
,
it
's
also
a
terrif
famili
film
.
This
is
the
true
stori
of
violin
teacher
Roberta
Guaspari
,
who
fought
the
school
board
to
keep
the
music
program
activ
in
a
hand
of
inner
citi
Harlem
school
.
It
could
also
be
describ
as
`
Mrs.
Streep
's
Opus
'
.
yes
,
Meryl
Streep
bring
her
dramat
clout
to
the
demand
role
of
Guaspari
,
and
that
bring
both
good
news
and
bad
.
Out
of
the
gate
,
possibl
becaus
of
her
distract
star
power
and
the
rush
write
,
it
is
relat
difficult
to
identifi
with
Roberta
's
charact
and
grasp
her
academ
point-of-view
.
She
is
veri
strict
with
her
student
,
but
what
insight
doe
that
creat
into
the
stori
?
Slowli
but
sure
,
we
begin
to
recogn
the
intent
of
the
charact
,
and
show
admir
for
the
thought
and
human
feel
that
Streep
has
onc
again
appli
.
One
thorough
interest
fact
about
`
Music
of
the
Heart
'
lie
with
the
unlik
presenc
in
the
director
's
chair
:
horror
veteran
Wes
Craven
.
After
leav
an
impress
with
the
`
Scream
'
film
and
the
origin
`
Nightmar
on
Elm
Street
'
,
Craven
has
attempt
a
precari
cross-ov
to
drama
.
At
first
,
his
inexperi
with
the
genr
is
fair
obvious
,
but
as
the
film
progress
Craven
find
a
surpris
comfort
nich
with
direct
this
materi
.
It
doe
n't
carri
the
heart-warm
courag
of
`
Mr.
Holland
's
Opus
'
,
but
`
Music
of
the
Heart
'
is
casual
assur
and
fill
with
littl
morsel
of
dramat
truth
.
The
tag
team
of
Streep
and
Craven
work
better
than
you
would
anticip
.
yes
,
Oscar
could
come
call
onc
again
for
Meryl
Streep
,
but
it
's
the
solid
ensembl
cast
that
make
`
Music
of
the
Heart
'
work
.
Angela
Bassett
display
her
usual
forc
stamina
as
Janet
William
,
the
princip
at
an
inner
citi
school
who
initi
doe
n't
hire
Roberta
becaus
of
her
lack
of
experi
.
Blue-ey
Adian
Quinn
is
endear
,
as
alway
,
play
a
new
love
interest
.
Gloria
Estefan
also
deliv
in
the
tini
role
of
a
support
second-grad
teacher
,
and
the
three
lead
actress
togeth
produc
a
flame
firebal
of
estrogen
forc
.
It
's
like
a
schoolteach
's
version
of
`
Thelma
and
Louis
'
,
in
a
restrain
but
effect
manner
.
The
movi
tackl
more
issu
than
just
Guaspari
's
teach
of
violin
.
There
's
some
power
moment
between
Roberta
and
her
two
son
,
who
must
cope
when
their
father
leav
them
for
anoth
woman
.
In
it
's
dramat
build-up
,
the
movi
manag
to
produc
some
authent
moment
of
feel
and
warmth
.
It
's
a
good
movi
for
anyon
to
see
,
although
miss
out
on
the
experi
would
not
be
a
life-alt
decis
.
It
's
commend
of
Wes
Craven
to
be
attempt
such
a
difficult
cross-ov
,
and
also
for
achiev
his
intric
goal
.
Watch
this
heartfelt
chick
flick
about
moral
and
music
instrument
,
who
may
ask
yourself
:
This
is
the
guy
who
direct
`
Scream
'
?
Of
cours
,
when
the
third
instal
of
that
seri
come
around
in
Februari
2000
-LRB-
with
Craven
direct
-RRB-
,
you
may
find
yourself
wonder
:
This
is
the
guy
who
direct
`
Music
of
the
Heart
'
?
Mission
accomplish
,
Wes
.
Thank
,
there
is
no
layer
of
artifici
sentiment
cover
the
film
.
In
it
's
entireti
,
it
's
a
wholesom
and
agreeabl
movi
for
the
whole
famili
,
despit
the
period
flaw
that
surfac
everi
onc
in
awhil
.
The
child
actor
are
cute
and
perform
up
to
par
,
even
if
some
of
their
problem
are
clichÃ©d
and
predict
in
the
extrem
.
The
mother
who
doe
n't
want
her
son
to
be
learn
`
white
man
's
music
'
,
the
unexpect
casual
...
basic
everyth
is
there
.
It
doe
n't
strike
the
perfect
chord
,
but
`
Music
of
the
Heart
'
is
high
convinc
.
The
uplift
true
stori
of
Roberta
Guaspari
could
have
been
told
better
,
but
`
Music
of
the
Heart
'
is
still
edifi
enough
to
proper
divulg
her
moral
.
