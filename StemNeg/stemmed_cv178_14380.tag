PERMANENT
MIDNIGHT
is
a
pretti
bad
movi
,
though
it
took
me
a
few
day
to
conclud
this
.
The
film
is
more
masturbatori
than
bleak
,
with
it
main
charact
intent
on
confound
us
with
his
stupid
.
-LRB-
He
has
a
$
6000
a
week
drug
habit
.
-RRB-
Ultimat
,
as
adapt
by
Veloz
,
Jerri
Stahl
come
off
as
one
of
those
playground
braggart
who
chainsmok
at
the
age
of
twelv
;
you
are
less
mystifi
by
his
self-destruct
natur
than
bore
into
a
stupor
yourself
.
Ben
Stiller
play
Stahl
,
a
young
author
who
arriv
in
L.A.
with
ambit
and
a
nasti
drug
habit
.
He
eventu
get
a
gig
for
$
5000/week
write
for
a
sitcom
call
Mr.
Chomper
-LRB-
a
thin
veil
stand-in
for
``
ALF
''
:
Chomper
look
just
like
ALF
except
he
's
blue
-RRB-
,
marri
a
produc
-LRB-
Hurley
-RRB-
so
she
can
get
a
green
card
,
and
hook
up
with
a
Spanish
mother
-LRB-
Liz
Torr
-RRB-
,
who
shoot
heroin
with
him
in
the
afternoon
.
Insert
proverbi
downward
spiral
here
.
PERMANENT
MIDNIGHT
is
structur
most
as
a
flashback
,
with
recov
addict
Bello
meet
Stiller
-LRB-
at
a
fastfood
restaur
,
where
Stiller
work
the
drive-thru
as
part
of
rehab
-RRB-
,
take
him
back
to
a
hotel
,
and
between
bout
of
serious
screw
,
listen
to
his
life
stori
.
I
ve
spent
the
last
week
tri
to
figur
out
whi
Stiller
never
seem
to
find
the
frighten
gorgeous
Hurley
attractive-wors
,
I
ve
been
tri
to
figur
out
whi
Hurley
DID
find
Stiller
attract
.
As
Stahl
,
Stiller
display
none
of
the
charm
or
wit
one
would
expect
-LRB-
post-Ther
's
Someth
About
Mari
-RRB-
of
either
the
actor
or
a
comedi
writer
.
What
separ
Stahl
from
the
hundr
of
other
Hollywood
punk-junki
,
it
seem
,
is
that
Stahl
wrote
a
book
about
his
idioci
.
Watch
Stahl
shoot
heroin
next
to
a
babi
!
Watch
Stahl
spoil
numer
pitch
meet
with
smack-fuel
babbl
!
Stiller
give
a
technic
flawless
perform
:
the
film
could
doubl
as
a
documentari
on
how
to
be
a
junki
.
But
PERMANENT
MIDNIGHT
is
most
soulless
.
When
the
movi
pose
the
question
Will
Stahl
be
save
?
and
then
answer
it
in
the
form
of
Bello
's
charact
-LRB-
basic
a
shrink
in
black
panti
-RRB-
,
could
a
person
care
less
?
In
the
film
version
of
his
autobiographi
of
the
same
name
,
Stahl
doe
n't
need
save
,
he
need
someon
who
will
sit
there
and
listen
to
him
go
on
about
himself
.
If
you
learn
anyth
about
the
other
charact
in
this
movi
,
it
's
that
they
are
the
most
incred
toler
Hollywood-typ
known
to
man
.
-LRB-
Stahl
also
seem
to
be
the
onli
person
at
schmooz
parti
do
drug
.
Is
this
Hollywood
...
California
?
-RRB-
I
learn
veri
littl
about
the
entertain
busi
from
PERMANENT
MIDNIGHT
and
a
whole
lot
about
an
egotist
lunkhead
.
Of
cours
you
know
that
Stahl
triumph
becaus
he
live
to
talk
about
his
problem
.
So
,
basic
,
his
drug
habit
got
him
a
book
deal
,
a
movi
base
on
his
life
,
and
now
he
's
appar
collabor
with
Stiller
on
futur
project
.
So
much
for
the
moral
of
that
stori
.
TEMPORARi
MIDNIGHT
is
more
like
it.-Bil
