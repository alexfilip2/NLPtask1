Peck
,
with

Pascal

begin
at
the
end
of
the
stori
of
the
young
polit

Jump
back
a
few
year
to
a
meet
among
the
black
leader
in
the
Belgian-own
Congo
.
A
third
class
postal
worker
,
Lumumba
,
speak
his
mind
to
head
of
the
most
power
tribe
,
proclaim
himself
not
tribal
,
not
region
,
but
a
nation
leader
.
His
small

mobil
parti
,
the
Congoles
Nation
Movement
-LRB-
MNC
-RRB-
is
gain
promin
and
Patric
leav
his
cleric
job
to
sell
beer
,
and
get
his
face
known
,
in
the
bustl
capit
,
Stanleyvill
.
At
a
time
when
the
coloni
empir
are
fall
down
around
the
world
,
Lumumba
is
in
the
right
place
at
the
right
time
and
,
through
polit
savvi
and
chess-lik
manipul
,
achiev
a
posit
of

of

As

The

soon
start
to
fall
apart
as
the
former

continu

the

Lumumba
wo
n't

help
of
the
US
,
know
that
they
would
tri
to
creat
de

and
Lumumba

This
tumultu
and
littl
known
period
of
modern
African
histori
saw
a
score
of
nation
struggl
for
independ
from
the
sometimes-odi

have
rule
much
of
the

from
their

Peck
focus
his
stori
on
familiar
materi
that
strive
to
give
an
honest
portray
of
Patric
Lumumba
,
his
friend
and
foe
and
the
independ
movement
that
grip
Africa
in
the
50

The
effort
involv
in
``
Lumumba
''
is
quit
ambiti
as
Peck
and
his
crew
befor
and
behind
the
camera
strive
to
bring
to
life
this
slice
of
world
histori
that
might
have
gone
unexplor
for
decad
,
if
at
all
.
Product
valu
are
first
rate
on
what
must
be
a
small
,
by
US
standard
,
budget
.
The
period
feel
and
realist
African
set
are
nice
maintain
in
a
product
that
travel
from
Zimbabw
to
Mozambiqu
.
The
screenplay
cover
a
lot
of
ground
and
doe
yeoman
's
work
in
provid
a
great
deal
of
detail
histori
while
tri
to
do
justic
to
the
stori
of
Lumumba
's
life
.
The
polit
side
of
thing
is
even
told
in
a
linear
,
straightforward
manner
that
teach
,
not
preach
.
It
concentr
on
the
good
deed
of
the
man
,
if
a
bit
as
a
stalwart
saint
,
but
doe
n't
embellish
on
a
larger
than
life
persona
.
The
famili
side
of
Patric
's
life
is
handl
in
sever
,
perfunctori
and
brief
interlud
that
show
him
talk
to
one
of
his
children
,
embrac
his
wife
or
lament
the
death
of
his
child
.
I
know
the
intent
is
to
flesh
the
man
out
,
but
too
short
a
shrift
is
given
to
the
famili
man
side
of
Lumumba
.
The
stori
,
as
such
,
has
a
lopsid
feel
about
it
.
High
mark
go
to
Eriq
Ebouaney
as
the
titl
charact
.
The
actor
give
a
convinc
,
charismat
perform
as
the
multifacet
,
polit
deft
Patric
Lumumba
who
has
the
good
of
his
peopl
and
his
countri
as
the
forc
drive
his
own
ambit
.
In
true
docudrama
tradit
,
the
support
cast
doe
not
outshin
the
star
,
complement
his
good
effort
,
instead
.
``
Lumumba
''
is
a
solid
,
interest
,
educ
and
honest
docudrama
that
should
appeal
to
film
buff
and
politico
,
both
.
It
has
more
intellig
in
it
tell
than
anyth
I
ve
seen
out
of
Hollywood
for
month
.
