One
would
think
that
David
Duchovni
,
star
of
the
cult
favorit
``
X-File
''
would
be
veri
care
in
choos
his
lead
man
cinema
role
.
At
least
one
would
hope
so
.
One
would
be
serious
incorrect
.
Eugen
Sand
-LRB-
Duchovni
-RRB-
is
a
surgeon
so
dedic
to
his
craft
that
he
becom
addict
to
amphetamin
to
stay
awak
and
work
more
.
It
turn
out
to
be
a
bad
plan
when
he
lose
a
patient
and
his
licens
while
under
the
influenc
.
Ten
month
later
,
in
a
seedi
bar
to
score
synthet
heroin
,
the
doctor
get
a
chanc
to
pli
his
trade
when
assassin
gun
down
a
custom
.
Using
a
plastic
water
bottl
and
bar
tube
,
Sand
oper
and
save
his
life
.
Smalltim
hoodlum
Raymond
Blossom
-LRB-
Timothi
Hutton
-RRB-
is
impress
with
the
cutleri
skill
on
his
associ
.
He
kidnap
and
then
offer
down-and-out
Eugen
a
posit
in
his
organ
.
Blossom
need
a
doctor
to
patch
up
gunshot
victim
that
would
be
problemat
at
a
hospit
.
Sand
's
temptat
is
that
this
will
give
him
a
chanc
to
practic
medicin
again
albeit
illeg
,
big
chunk
of
cash
to
fuel
his
habit
and
close
proxim
to
the
gangster
's
womanfriend
Clair
-LRB-
Angelina
Joli
-RRB-
,
this
film
's
babe
factor
.
The
would-b
big
time
oper
is
desper
in
need
of
help
.
On
the
run
from
Russian
mobster
-LRB-
the
bad
guy
that
seem
to
be
all
the
rage
in
this
year
's
film
-RRB-
and
tri
to
cut
a
pirat
softwar
deal
with
the
Chines
Mafia
,
Blossom
is
surround
by
blood
.
After
a
few
medic
misadventur
,
the
physician
grow
disench
with
his
employ
.
An
encount
with
a
coupl
of
psycho
surfer
dude
who
threaten
to
blow
him
away
unless
he
``
fix
''
their
dead
buddi
cement
his
feel
that
he
is
in
the
wrong
line
of
work
.
When
the
FBI
visit
and
forc
him
to
becom
an
inform
,
there
is
no
question
that
he
need
to
be
somewher
els
.
Oddli
enough
,
these
seem
like
they
could
be
excit
scene
.
The
film
disprov
that
assumpt
.
Then
a
bunch
of
other
uninterest
thing
happen
.
Write
this
onli
two
day
after
see
the
film
,
it
a
struggl
to
rememb
the
event
.
you
can
take
that
as
a
solid
lack
of
recommend
.
For
all
the
cool
that
Duchovni
exhibit
in
``
X-File
''
,
it
's
a
surpris
that
his
big
screen
presenc
is
so
lack
in
charisma
.
The
doctor
is
particular
bland
and
dull
.
Even
the
cold
turkey
bit
which
is
rife
with
dramat
possibl
come
across
as
banal
.
A
littl
chocol
and
minor
sweat
get
him
through
heroin
withdraw
.
Like
virtual
everyth
els
in
the
film
,
it
's
a
miss
opportun
.
The
Fox
Mulder
detach
doe
n't
work
here
.
Oscar-winn
Hutton
's
manic
mobster
is
much
more
difficult
to
get
a
handl
on
.
Play
partial
for
comedi
and
partial
as
craze
killer
,
Blossom
almost
becom
real
,
but
then
sink
into
goofi
.
Most
of
the
time
Hutton
look
as
if
he
's
search
for
his
charact
and
come
up
empti
.
Joli
also
make
a
few
fals
move
toward
creat
a
three-dimension
human
be
befor
give
up
and
turn
into
sceneri
.
The
most
interest
aspect
of
her
perform
is
watch
her
pouti
lip
threaten
to
take
over
the
screen
.
The
rest
are
n't
ani
better
.
Michael
Masse
's
eccentr
FBI
agent
never
rev
up
.
One
of
Blossom
's
henchmen
steal
a
few
moment
of
the
show
as
a
quirki
gunman
reminisc
of
Val
Kilmer
's
Doc
Holliday
in
``
Tombston
''
.
His
two-gun
blast
as
he
doe
a
bizarr
danc
is
the
high
point
of
the
film
.
But
thatsecond
is
n't
worth
sit
through
the
otherminut

First

director
Andi
Wilson

appear
to
be
attempt
to
jump

The
best
of
these

The

one
of

``

neither

The
