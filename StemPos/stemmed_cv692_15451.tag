When

For

Best

it
is

More
than

it
is
a

``

pick
up
precis
where
``

Have

competit
,
Farmer
Hoggett
-LRB-
Jame
Cromwel
-RRB-
and
his

A

and
hilari

lead
to
Mrs.
Hoggett
take
Babe
from
the
small
countri

In

so
,
the
film
transport
us
into
a
wonder
imagin
world
that
simultan
mirror
and
exceed
the
creativ

``

flourish
where
so
mani

fail

Most
sequel
simpli
rehash
the
event
of
the
first

.
Not
``
Babe
:
Pig
in
the
Citi
''
.
This
is
a
complet
origin
tale
that
offer
up
a
stori
drastic
differ
than
the
first
.
Also
,
by
not
be
content
to
util
most
of
the
old
charact
,
this
film
give
us
mani
new
one
to
enjoy
.
In
essenc
,
it
doe
n't
attempt
to
copi
itself
.
Instead
,
it
strive
to
achiev
an
origin
of
it
own
.
And
it
succeed
.
That
's
not
to
say
the
familiar
is
absent
.
``
Babe
:
Pig
in
the
Citi
''
retain
some
of
the
best
core
element
and
charact
from
the
first
film
.
Along
with
Babe
himself
,
Ferdinand
the
Duck
come
along
for
the
ride
,
as
doe
Mrs.
Hoggett
-LRB-
one
of
this
decad
's
best
and
most
underappreci
comic
character
,
hilari
perform
by
Magda
Szubanski
-RRB-
.
The
three
sing
mice
also
make
the
journey
,
chime
in
with
their
cute
high-pitch
vocal
.
The
stori
structur
is
also
similar
as
each
segment
is
introduc
with
titl
card
read
by
the
aforement
mice
.
From
there
,
we
are
guid
onc
again
by
Rosco
Lee
Brown
's
sooth
deep
narrat
.
Compos
Nigel
Westlak
also
return
with
his
whimsic
music
style
that
is
perfect
for
cinemat
fabl
such
as
these
.
But
these
element
are
simpli
the
frame
that
surround
an
entir
new
paint
.
While
stay
at
the
Flealand
Hotel
,
Babe
encount
a
verit
Ark-full
of
new
anim
.
Monkey
,
kitten
,
and
dog
of
various
breed
and
size
are
some
of
the
new
``
urbanit
''
that
Babe
befriend
,
as
well
as
some
wonder
comic
Pelican
that
Ferdinand
the
Duck
happen
to
encount
.
Each
charact
is
distinct
uniqu
,
some
of
which
are
imbu
with
person
human-lik
struggl
that
are
endear
and
touch
.
And
while
this
world
focus
larg
on
these
anim
,
we
are
introduc
to
two
new
human
charact
as
well
.
Mari
Stein
play
the
owner
of
the
Flealand
Hotel
,
an
animal-lov
young
spinster
who
harbor
these
lost
creatur
much
to
the
dismay
anger
of
her
fellow
neighbor
.
Stein
's
landladi
is
a
wonder
odd
caricatur
.
We
also
meet
Fug
Floom
,
an
old
soft-spoken
clown
who
own
mani
of
the
anim
in
The
Flealand
Hotel
,
util
them
as
a
part
of
the
act
that
he
perform
at
differ
parti
and
function
.
Not
have
known
who
portray
Fug
Floom
prior
to
see
the
film
,
it
came
as
an
unexpect
pleasant
surpris
to
see
who
it
was
.
So
as
not
to
ruin
this
well-kept
secret
,
I
wo
n't
reveal
the
actor
's
ident
here
.
It
was
a
treat
inde
to
see
one
of
cinema
's
legend
grace
the
screen
again
in
what
was
a
superbl
gentl
and
heartwarm
perform
.
The
greatest
triumph
of
``
Babe
:
Pig
in
the
Citi
''
is
the
art
direct
.
Simpli
put
--
it
bleed
creativ
,
take
the
look
of
the
origin
film
to
a
whole
new
level
.
Restrict
primarili
to
a
farm
the
first
time
around
,
this
second
instal
creat
an
entir
citi
,
dazzl
us
with
uniqu
fable-lik
architectur
.
But
the
stroke
of
pure
genius
by
Product
Design
Roger
Ford
is
his
use
of
our
world
's
architectur
landmark
.
Design
a
skylin
that
includ
the
Statu
of
Liberti
,
the
Sydney
Opera
Hous
,
the
Brooklyn
Bridg
,
the
Hollywood
sign
and
the
Eiffel
Tower
,
Ford
has
creat
a
singular
citi
that
encompass
all
of
our
citi
-LRB-
as
seen
in
the
film
photo
and
pre-product
draw
to
your
right
-RRB-
.
Added
to
that
,
mani
of
this
citi
's
street
are
the
twin
sibl
of
Venic
's
gondola-trekk
river
.
The
Metropoli
that
has
sprung
from
Ford
's
vision
is
a
wondrous
sight
to
behold
.
It
is
a
world
that
you
want
to
walk
around
in
.
Norma
Moriceau
's
costum
design
belong
in
this
world
,
vibrant
in
color
and
style
equal
to
that
of
the
Ford
's
landscap
.
Most
of
the
costum
are
imagin
cartoonish
,
with
the
most
exot
grand
design
go
to
that
of
Fug
Floom
's
clown
outfit
.
Andrew
Lesni
's
photographi
captur
these
element
with
various
light
mood
that
are
beauti
effect
in
creat
the
film
's
multipl
emot
tone
.
Much
press
fodder
has
been
made
over
the
week
lead
up
to
the
releas
of
``
Babe
:
Pig
in
the
Citi
''
.
Report
state
that
it
origin
cut
was
brand
with
a
PG-13
rate
.
These
report
were
discov
to
be
fals
as
it
was
assign
a
PG
rate
.
But
even
so
,
to
be
anyth
harsher
than
the
origin
'
s
G
rate
had
mani
parent
and
fan
up
in
arm
.
By
delet
a
minim
number
of
shot
,
``
Babe
:
Pig
in
the
Citi
''
was
eventu
given
the
covet
G
rate
.
Although
appeas
,
mani
fan
were
still
concern
that
it
would
be
too
dark
,
fear
that
the
film
may
have
come
to
be
possess
by
Tim
Burton
himself
.
Well
,
to
coin
a
phrase
,
the
report
of
``
Babe
:
Pig
in
the
Citi
''
's
death
at
the
hand
of
a
dark
,
scari
,
Felliniesqu
interpret
have
been
great
exagger
.
Grant
it
has
it
moment
of
pseudo-morbid
,
but
all-in-al
``
Babe
:
Pig
in
the
Citi
''
is
the
funni
and
charm
adventur
that
everyon
was
hope
it
would
be
.
Whatev
``
dark
''
moment
it
may
have
can
be
attribut
to
director
Georg
Miller
-LRB-
the
``
Mad
Max
''
trilog
,
``
The
Witch
of
Eastwick
''
,
``
Lorenzo
's
Oil
''
-RRB-
.
Have
serv
as
a
produc
and
co-writ
on
the
first
film
,
Miller
move
into
the
director
's
chair
for
this
one
,
put
his
own
uniqu
sens
of
style
into
this
bud
franchis
.
The
stori
of
``
Babe
:
Pig
in
the
Citi
''
is
an
enchant
yarn
,
but
one
that
doe
n't
achiev
the
emot
or
charact
depth
of
the
origin
.
Miss
here
is
the
attempt
to
broach
such
headi
theme
as
person
ident
,
an
individu
's
worth
,
challeng
conform
,
and
one
's
purpos
in
life
.
``
Babe
''
dealt
with
this
weighti
subject
matter
,
creat
a
timeless
fabl
.
``
Babe
:
Pig
in
the
Citi
''
should
not
have
rehash
these
theme
,
but
I
do
wish
it
would
have
attempt
to
explor
new
one
.
This
film
is
not
bereft
of
moral
or
messag
as
it
parallel
such
issu
as
urban
strife
,
class
differ
,
sacrifici
courag
,
and
so
on
.
But
this
film
's
goal
are
n't
as
lofti
as
the
first
's
,
instead
choos
to
take
a
more
straightforward
approach
,
allow
it
theme
to
take
a
back
seat
to
an
excit
,
sometim
intens
,
fabl
adventur
that
is
undeni
clever
and
invent
.
``
Babe
:
Pig
in
the
Citi
''
also
decid
against
develop
a
relationship
to
the
level
of
which
was
present
in
the
first
film
,
specif
the
one
between
Farmer
Hoggett
and
Babe
.
Hoggett
's
love
for
Babe
,
which
grew
ever
so
gentl
,
is
what
gave
that
film
it
charm
and
endear
qualiti
.
Best
exemplifi
in
Hoggett
's
danc
for
Babe
,
this
move
relationship
was
truli
uniqu
.
It
is
someth
that
I
wish
would
have
been
present
again
-LRB-
and
could
have
through
Fug
Floom
-RRB-
,
but
was
not
.
Pleas
understand
,
these
are
not
negat
critic
,
per
se
'
,
but
simpli
statement
of
what
I
see
as
the
differ
between
``
Babe
:
Pig
in
the
Citi
''
be
a
veri
good
film
and
the
origin
be
a
great
one
.
But
have
said
that
,
these
observ
are
minor
critiqu
at
best
.
As
an
overal
piec
,
``
Babe
:
Pig
in
the
Citi
''
is
a
thorough
enchant
and
entertain
fabl
from
begin
to
end
.
Sure
,
it
is
n't
a
great
film
,
but
it
is
an
excel
one
that
possess
element
of
great
.
It
is
a
film
that
is
magic
with
it
charm
and
humor
,
excit
in
it
adventur
exploit
,
funni
with
it
dri
wit
and
cute
voic
,
and
breathtak
in
it
present
.
``
Babe
:
Pig
in
the
Citi
''
may
not
be
moviemak
at
it
absolut
best
,
but
it
is
on
level
of
cinemat
qualiti
that
is
rare
achiev
or
seen
in
cinema
.
As
a
result
,
if
you
choos
to
let
this
film
pass
you
by
,
you
will
be
miss
of
the
year
's
best
cinemat
treat
.
