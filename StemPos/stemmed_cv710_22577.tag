`
Run
Lola
Run
'
,
a
German
import
that
gain
a
stellar
reput
at
the
Sundanc
Film
Festiv
,
is
a
dazzl
and
kinet
film
that
deal
with
the
subject
of
fate
and
chanc
.
For
a
berserk
and
retroact
minut
of
non-stop
movement
,
we
follow
a
fiery-hair
heroin
name
Lola
-LRB-
Franka
Potent
-RRB-
as
she
sprint
to
save
her
boyfriend
from
the
clutch
of
drug
dealer
.
Lola
has
rough
twenti
minut
to
somehow
retriev
100,000
mark
in
time
to
save
Manni
-LRB-
Moritz
Bleibtreu
-RRB-
from
be
kill
by
the
dealer
.
But
,
in
someth
of
a
pseudo
-
`
Groundhog
Day
'
approach
,
director
Tom
Tykwer
give
Lola
three
separ
chanc
to
best
navig
her
way
toward
the
goal
.
In
these
trio
of
episod
,
we
gradual
learn
the
uniqu
effect
of
fate
,
for
even
if
tini
chang
are
made
in
Lola
's
journey
,
the
futur
can
be
serious
alter
.
`
Run
Lola
Run
'
is
an
experi
like
`
Fight
Club
'
or
`
The
Matrix
'
,
in
that
each
film
take
you
through
a
super-charg
wormhol
of
bend
realiti
in
surreal
and
excit
way
.
In
addit
,
all
three
movi
have
a
visual
style
that
separ
them
from
the
rest
of
the
pack
.
`
Lola
'
is
no
except
,
with
stylish
quick-flash
camera
work
and
cinematographi
that
serv
as
scintil
eye
candi
from
the
get-go
.
Tykwer
's
world
is
a
landscap
of
mood
and
color
,
with
brilliant
shade
of
red
and
pink
-LRB-
includ
Lola
's
fieri
hair
-RRB-
use
as
effect
symbol
throughout
.
With
it
's
visual
style
and
mind-blow
pace
,
`
Run
Lola
Run
'
is
one
of
the
more
invigor
movi
of
the
year
.
Even
more
so
when
consid
the
fact
it
's
all
stuf
rather
nonchal
into
an
81-minut
time
period
.
As
a
heroin
,
Potent
doe
littl
more
than
run
wild
through
the
street
-LRB-
as
the
titl
suggest
-RRB-
,
but
she
has
a
certain
flair
and
charisma
.
Her
exemplari
run
form
made
me
wonder
if
she
is
actual
a
track
star
.
Meanwhil
,
Bleibtreu
doe
an
equal
fantast
job
of
bring
the
dopey
but
passion
Manni
to
life
.
Both
actor
perform
beyond
the
call
of
duti
.
The
dazzl
fun
come
from
predict
what
each
episod
hold
in
store
for
Lola
,
and
the
outcom
is
ultim
rewarding-sever
twist
and
turn
are
uniqu
and
unexpect
.
The
other
charact
Lola
run
into
-LRB-
both
purpos
and
inadvert
-RRB-
includ
her
banker
father
-LRB-
Herbert
Kraup
-RRB-
and
a
friend
secur
guard
-LRB-
Armin
Rohd
-RRB-
,
but
asid
from
the
two
lead
,
no
one
has
more
than
a
few
minut
of
screen
time
.
Addition
star
that
could
n't
possibl
be
ignor
are
cinematograph
Frank
Grieb
and
editor
Mathild
Bonnefroy
,
who
are
both
respons
for
the
film
's
eye-catch
visual
eleg
.
`
Run
Lola
Run
'
is
subtitl
,
so
be
prepar
to
meet
the
challeng
of
read
the
lightning-fast
dialogue-occasion
section
of
it
are
especi
fast
.
This
is
onli
one
of
the
minor
chore
involv
in
watch
.
The
other
is
the
sens
that
we
never
get
to
realli
recogn
who
the
real
peopl
are
in
this
hyperact
situat
.
Most
are
just
chess
piec
in
Tykwer
's
elabor
game
of
visual
present
,
and
he
never
realli
make
a
signific
move
with
ani
.
But
,
the
averag
viewer
is
like
to
be
so
absorb
in
the
action
that
few
will
realiz
the
lack
of
potenc
in
a
few
element
of
the
screenplay
.
A
few
petti
gripe
asid
,
this
film
is
a
wild
,
exhilar
ride
that
turn
maniac
on
it
wheel
of
origin
.
Most
peopl
believ
foreign
film
are
main
bore
,
talki
charact
studi
.
Perhap
`
Run
Lola
Run
'
will
recharg
their
batteri
.
Not
onli
doe
this
film
offer
insight
into
some
intrigu
question
of
fate
and
destini
,
it
also
deliv
a
white-knuckl
visual
rollercoast
ride
of
overwhelm
audac
.
Like
how
the
experi
must
have
been
for
the
persist
titl
charact
,
`
Run
Lola
Run
'
is
exhaust
.
