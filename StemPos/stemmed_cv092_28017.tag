the
draw
on

as
a
punish
.
His

dilemma
is
that
he
got
caught
run
illeg
booz
by
truck
and
face
a
3-5
year
stretch
in
New
Hampshir
,
someth
he
feel
will
be
a
life
sentenc
for
him
sinc
he
doe
n't
think
he
could
surviv
prison
at
his
age
.
He
is
also
concern
that
his
wife
and
three
kid
will
have
to
go
on
welfar
.
He
could
have
cut
a
deal
and
gotten
off
,
if
he
turn
his
boss
over
to
the
D.A.
,
but
he
figur
he

never
live
if
he
did
that
.
He
is
current
gun-run
for
a
gang
of
veri
success
bank
robber
led
by
Scalis
-LRB-
Rocco
-RRB-
.
The
mask
bank
robber
oper
by
alway
first
go
to
the
bank
manag
's
hous
and
hold
his
famili
hostag
and
then
they
go
to
the
bank
and
forc
the
manag
to
open
the
vault
for
them
or
els
his
famili
get
it
.
On
one
of
the
heist
,
they
kill
a
bank
offic
who
push
the
alarm
.
Coyl
's
best
friend
is
Dillon
-LRB-
Boyl
-RRB-
,
a
hit
man
for
the
mob
,
work
as
a
bartend
.
He
is
a
perman
stooli
for
the
treasuri
agent
,
as
an
aggress
young
agent
name
Foley
-LRB-
Jordan
-RRB-
,
who
like
to
be
call
uncl
,
give
Dillon
breath
room
to
oper
some
of
his
low-level
crime
activ
and
to
work
the
bar
even
though
he
has
a
prison
record
,
as
long
as
he
keep
get
valuabl
info
from

the
gang
.
With
the
sentenc
date
close
in
on
him
,
the
alreadi
convict
Coyl
is
out
on
bail
and
look
for
an
angl
to
cut
his
jail
time
.
He
contact
agent
Foley
and
give
him
a
few
inconsequenti
tip
and
then
decid
to
do
someth
that
goe
against
his
grain
.
Think
he
made
an
iron-clad
deal
with
Foley
to
get
his
sentenc
squash
in
New
Hampshir
,
he
give
him
the
place

a
sale

machin
gun
is
go
down
,
know
full-wel
the
young
hustler
-LRB-
Keat
-RRB-
sell
the
gun
is
a
lot
like
he
was
as
a
youth
and
when
arrest
will
be
face
a
life
sentenc
.
But
Foley
tell
him
after
he
arrest
the
gun-deal
,
that
New
Hampshir
want
more
befor
they
take
away
his
jail
sentenc
,
they
want
him
to
be
a
full-tim
inform
.
Warn
:
spoiler
follow
in
next
paragraph
.
The
bank
robber
are
setup
and
caught
in
the
act
and
the
mob
boss
is
convinc
Coyl
did
it
and
give
Dillon
the
contract
to
take
care
of
his
friend
.
The
contemptu
Dillon
befriend
Coyl
and
treat
him
to
a
steak
dinner
and
take
him
to
a
Bruin
hockey
game
while
get
him
booz
up
.
Coyl
take
a
look
at
the
young
Bruin
star
Bobbi
Orr
from
his
upper
deck
seat
and
say
,
``
To
be
young
like
that
and
have
his
futur
,
he
's
the
greatest
hockey
player
in
the
world
.
''
Dillon
then
take
the
drunken
Coyl
for
a
long
drive
and
execut
him
mob-styl
,
have
a
kid
who
work
for
him
dump
the
bodi
in
some
bad
section
of
Boston
.
This
is
a
great
atmospher
film
due
to
the
realist
noir
mood
it
set
,
of
the
hopeless
situat
the
low-level
crimin
are
in
,
and
how
they
are
forc
to
live
with
fear
and
the
uncertainti
of
what
horribl
thing
will
happen
next
.
The
citi
street
are
ugli
,
the
gangster
are
shown
to
be
capabl
of
ani
action
to
defend
their
own
interest
,
whether
it
is
betray
or
murder
.
There
is
a
fatalist
feel
about
their
live
,
someth
Robert
Mitchum
wear
as
easili
as
other
put
on
a
hat
.
Mitchum
give
this
film
all
the
intens
and
purpos
it
need
,
as
it
overcom
a
thin
plot
.
It
make
you
see
the
charact
for
what
they
are
without
ani
fals
sympathi
for
them
.
Mitchum
is
a
loser
;
and
,
that
he
live
so
long
,
is
a
tribut
to
his
skill
as
a
survivor
.
But
in
the
end
,
he
even
lose
the
respect
he
had
among
his
underworld
friend
as
a
standup
guy
,
as
he
wrestl
with
his
code
of
honor
and
lost
even
that
battl
.
