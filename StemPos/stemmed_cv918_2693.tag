WyATT
EARP
has
a
lot
to
tell
and
littl
to
say
.
This
stori
of
the
legendari
lawman
run
three
hour
and
nine
minut
and
that
's
too
long
for
this
epic-wannab
that
play
more
like
a
TV
mini-seri
than
a
movi
.
The
stori
open
on
the
Earp
famili
farm
,
with
young
Wyatt
readi
to
run
away
from
home
.
He
want
to
fight
in
the
Civil
War
,
but
his
dad
-LRB-
Hackman
-RRB-
has
differ
idea
and
want
his
son
to
studi
law
.
Time
pass
and
Wyatt
head
west
,
return
home
to
marri
,
and
,
after
a
spell
,
begin
his
career
in
law
enforc
.
By
the
time
he
-LRB-
Costner
-RRB-
and
his
brother
-LRB-
Madsen
,
David
Andrew
,
and
Linden
Ashbi
-RRB-
arriv
in
Tombston
,
Wyatt
has
tri
his
hand
at
everyth
from

buffalo
to

.
WyATT
EARP
is
veri
appeal
in
place
--
such
as
cast
,
costum
,
and
cinematographi
--
but
an
overst
stori
and
overpow
score
deaden
most
of
the
emot
impact
.
Who
can
be
move
by
scene
after
scene
after
scene
of
swell
string
and
suffoc
speech
?
Somber
is
fine
--
just
ask
Clint
Eastwood
--
but
this
film
that
boast
not
one
,
not
two
,
but
three
,
count
em
three
,
hammi
death
scene
!
Still
,
a
littl
bit
of
EARP
goe
a
long
way
and
the
life
and
time
of
the
legendari
lawman
are
from
uninterest
stuff
.
His
,
uh
,
unusu
relat
with
women
,
for
exampl
,
are
an
intrigu
contrast
to
his
charact
's
credo
of
``
noth
count
as
much
as
blood

Equalli

a
buffalo-hunt

sequenc
that

non-PC
.
Director
Lawrenc
Kasdan
take
a
refresh
realist
approach
to
the
gunplay
.
The
infam
gunfight
at
the
OK
Corral
is
both
brutal
and
brief
,
devoid
of
almost
ani
theatric
.
Do
n't
look
for
much
glorifi
violenc
here
.
Despit

Kevin
Costner
is

good
in

Danc
With

never

as
steeli
as
the
role
requir
,
though
,
but
his
transform
from
lightheart
law
student
to
stoic
sheriff
is
fun
to
watch
.
He
was
tougher
in
A
PERFECT
WORLD
.
His
foil
is
Denni
Quaid
,
who
pull
a

40

to
play
the
tubercular
terror
Doc
Holliday

he
's
a
scene
stealer

Both
Gene
Hackman

appear
and
disappear
like
magic
,
while
late

Catherin
O'Hara
