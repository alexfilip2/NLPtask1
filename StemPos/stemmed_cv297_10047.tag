Henc
,

,
director
Jean-Pierr
Jeunet
,
and
the
other
behind
Alien
Resurrect
face
a
two-fold
challeng
--
not
onli
somehow
resurrect
Ripley
,
but
also
rescu
this
once-profit
seri
from
the
scrap
heap
.
Despit
the
odd
,
they
have
succeed
,
even
if
the
entertain
new
instal
doe
not
measur
up
to
the
excel
first
two
.
Writer
Joss
Whedon
devis
a
quick
,
easi
,
and
painless
answer
to
the
dead
Ripley
problem
--
clone
her
,
which
is
what
shadi
militari
scientist
do
use
some
blood
left
behind
on
Fiorina
161
,
the
prison
planet
of
the
third
film
.
That
done
,
the
_
real
_
challeng
present
itself
--
what
do
with
her
.
Alien
introduc
Ripley
as
smart
and
resourc
;
Alien
simultan
toughen
her
up
and
made
her
more
vulner
,
explor
her
matern
side
;
Alien3
saw
her
undergo
the
seven
stage
of
death
.
What
could
be
next
?
Whedon
come
up
with
a
clever
spin
:
sinc
the
origin
Ripley
die
while
impregn
with
an
Alien
queen
,
the
blood
use
for
the
clone
is
also
``
infect
''
with
Alien
DNA
.
So
the
new
Ripley
is
,
inde
,
new
--
a
human/Alien
hybrid
bless
with
heighten
instinct
and
strength
,
a
psychic
bond
with
the
dead
speci
,
and
a
more
predatori
attitud
.
Unfortun
,
that
is
where
Alien
Resurrect
's
clever
streak
in
write
stop
.
The
Alien
seri
is
known
for
have
stronger
stori
than
most
creatur
featur
.
But
the
stori
in
Resurrect
is
more
of
an
afterthought
.
The
movi
begin
with
a
plot
involv
some
militari
type
attempt
to
train
Alien
to
do
their
bid
,
but
onc
the
creatur
break
free
,
it
is
onc
again
Ripley
and
a
ragtag
crew
-LRB-
this
time
a
bunch
of
interstellar
smuggler
,
includ
tough
waif
Call
,
play
by
a
game
Winona
Ryder
-RRB-
tri
to
extermin
them
.
And
the
Alien
Ripley
scenario
is
ultim
not
exploit
to
it
full
potenti
;
I
would
have
like
deeper
explor
into
the
quandari
of
becom
one
of
the
speci
she
has
spent
her
entir
life
tri
to
destroy
.
While
the
settl
into
tried-and-tru
formula
is
a
littl
disconcert
,
the
formula
is
tried-and-tru
for
a
reason
,
and
Jeunet
tackl
the
proceed
with
giddi
abandon
.
The
Alien
,
after
all
these
year
,
is
still
terrifi
,
and
a
new
breed
that
is
introduc
is
no
less
so
.
The
violenc
is
appropri
grisli
and
extrem
,
and
the
action
set
piec
are
suspens
and
excit
,
most
notabl
an
extend
underwat
sequenc
.
The
film
is
absolut
mesmer
visual
,
thank
to
the
solid
work
done
by
product
design
Nigel
Phelp
and
cinematograph
Darius
Khondji
.
As
technic
adept
as
Jeunet
's
direct
is
,
perhap
his
-LRB-
and
,
for
that
matter
,
Whedon
's
-RRB-
greatest
contribut
is
the
infus
of
humor
into
this
notabl
downbeat
and
serious
seri
.
A
sens
of
humor
may
seem
to
go
against
everyth
this
horror
show
stand
for
,
but
the
self-awar
of
the
excess
just
add
to
the
fun
.
No
,
Alien
Resurrect
is
not
the
great
film
that
Ridley
Scott
's
Alien
or
the
even
greater
film
that
Jame
Cameron
's
Alien
was
.
But
after
the
daunt
slow
gloom
and
doom
of
Fincher
's
Alien3
,
Jeunet
's
Resurrect
is
a
welcom
return
to
it
root
as
a
wild
,
reckless
thrill
ride
.
That
is
what
made
the
Alien
seri
so
popular
in
the
first
place
,
and
that
is
what
will
keep
the
seri
popular
in
ani
futur
instal
.
