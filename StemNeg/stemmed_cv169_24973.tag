this

There
's
a
world
of
differ
between
artist
and
technician
.
The
artist
has
a
vision
to
creat
someth
new
.
He
may
not
do
it
well
,
it
might
be
sloppi
,
but
it
's
someth
you
ve
never
seen
befor
.
A
good
technician
can
make
it
look
good
,
but
without
direct
from
his
own
inner
artist
or
someon
els
,
it
's
go
to
be
just
a
Xerox
.
Obviousli
success
film
need
both
skill
.
Brian
De
Palma
is
a
master
technician
.
He
's
spent
his
career
copi
other
,
most
notabl
Hitchcock
.
He
usual
know
exact
what
to
do
to
make
a
scene
work
,
but
onli
becaus
he
has
learn
it
by
rote
.
Aside
from
rare
flash
of
origin
,
his
film
are
often
soul-dead
.
In
De
Palma
's
latest
,
he
turn
his
attent
to
Stanley
Kubrick
.
To
tell
the
truth
,
I
enjoy
portion
of
this
movi
,
but
I
like
it
a
lot
better
over
30
year
ago
when
it
was
call
``
2001
''
.
I
enjoy
it
even
more
when
it
was
titl
``
Close
Encounter
''
.
NASA
has
set
it
sight
for
Mar
.
When
the
first
crew
meet
with
disast
,
a
rescu
mission
is
sent
to
the
red
planet
.
They
do
n't
do
so
well
either
,
but
eventu
meet
up
the
lone
surviv
astronaut-gone-Rasta
and
solv
the
mysteri
of
the
univers
.
And
it
's
all
so
bore
.
There
are
so
mani
scene
that
just
do
n't
work
,
it
's
difficult
to
begin
.
When
the
first
crew
is
a
few
feet
away
from
a
rage
massiv
upside-down
Martian
tornado
-LRB-
which
look
remark
like
a
sandworm
from
``
Dune
''
-RRB-
destroy
everyth
in
it
path
,
they
just
hang
out
watch
.
Error
.
The
most
interest
charact
-LRB-
and
that
's
not
say
much
-RRB-
is
kill
off
.
Error
.
The
alien
is
laughabl
.
Error
.
The
rest
of
the
charact
are
the
dullest
peopl
imagin
.
Error
.
There
's
some
nice
eyecandi
.
The
face
on
Mar
,
which
turn
out
to
be
a
giant
metal
Thai
Buddha
head
,
look
cool
.
A
three-dimension
holograph
planetarium
is
more
fun
to
watch
than
anyth
at
Disney
World
.
Maneuv
in
space
suit
outsid
the
ship
seem
realist
.
But
there
's
so
much
more
that
feel
as
if
we
ve
been
there
befor
.
From
``
2001
''
,
there
's
the
rotat
space
station
,
the
blind
white
room
.
>
From
``
Close
Encounter
''
,
they
solv
a
sound
puzzl
and
play
it
to
the
alien
.
The
list
goe
on
.
The
actor
are
most
mobil
wooden
statu
.
Even
Gari
Sinis
and
Tim
Robbin
ca
n't
muster
enough
emot
to
convinc
us
they
are
breath
.
No
one
seem
to
care
about
anyth
that
happen
.
you
wo
n't
either
.
The
absolut
worst
sin
is
the
blatant
product
placement
as
Dr.
Pepper
,
with
a
20
foot
tall
logo
,
save
the
day
.
They
should
save
the
commerci
for
those
insipid
bit
befor
the
film
.
