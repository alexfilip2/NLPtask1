Robert
Benton
has
assembl
a
stellar
,
matur
cast
for
his
latest
featur
,
Twilight
,
a
film
noir
mysteri
set
amid
the
fade
star
of
Hollywood
.
Paul
Newman
star
as
retir
detect
Harri
Ross
.
Harri
has
spent
the
last
coupl
of
year
do
odd
job
for
Jack
and
Catherin
Ames
-LRB-
Gene
Hackman
and
Susan
Sarandon
-RRB-
,
a
pair
of
marri
actor
who
have
fallen
from
the
limelight
.
When
Jack
send
him
on
a
routin
deliveri
job
,
howev
,
the
old
instinct
kick
in
.
Soon
,
Harri
is
wade
through
a
mysteri
where
friendship
and
live
are
on
the
line
,
and
he
no
longer
know
who
to
trust
.
There
are
plenti
of
familiar
face
throughout
Twilight
,
in
addit
to
Newman
,
Hackman
and
Sarandon
.
Jame
Garner
play
Raymond
Hope
,
a
former
cop
and
one
of
Harri
's
best
friend
.
Stockard
Chan
play
Verna
,
Harri
's
former
partner
,
and
possibl
a
former
love
interest
.
Rees
Witherspoon
is
Mel
,
the
distrust
daughter
of
the
Ames
'
,
and
Liev
Schrieber
is
her
scuzzi
boyfriend
.
Giancarlo
Esposito
appear
as
Harri
's
bumbl
detect
protigi
,
and
John
Spencer
is
a
suspici
polic
captain
.
With
a
cast
like
that
,
it
's
almost
worth
watch
Twilight
just
to
stargaz
.
Luckili
,
there
's
more
to
the
film
than
some
sort
of
actor
's
recognit
ceremoni
.
Twilight
has
a
solid
film
noir-ish
plot
.
It
may
not
have
as
mani
twist
and
turn
as
some
of
the
classic
,
but
it
has
much
more
than
a
lot
of
what
pass
for
film
these
day
.
The
major
cast
member
all
deliv
strong
perform
,
as
can
be
expect
of
their
calib
.
Howev
,
none
of
them
have
that
littl
extra
oomph
which
would
make
them
memor
.
The
support
cast
is
enjoy
,
if
a
littl
underdrawn
.
Stockard
Chan
's
charact
,
in
particular
,
is
a
cipher
.
There
's
more
to
her
charact
than
the
film
take
the
time
to
describ
.
It
's
a
minor
,
but
irrit
,
flaw
.
With
a
solid
cast
,
and
a
good
plot
,
there
's
a
lot
to
recommend
about
Twilight
.
It
's
biggest
flaw
is
actual
it
short
run
time
.
At
a
slim
94
minut
,
there
's
a
lot
of
stuff
that
's
pack
into
an
aw
small
packag
.
Still
,
the
chanc
to
see
Newman
,
Sarandon
and
Hackman
work
togeth
is
worth
a
cramp
or
two
.
