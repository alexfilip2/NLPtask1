of
the
best
perform
of
his
career
as
the
loathabl
redneck
Donni

,
there
is
littl

Ridic

``
The
Gift
''
is
one
of
those
movi
that
make
you
wonder
where
you
ve
seen
this
stori
befor
.
It
's
a
collect
of
everi
clich
and
stereotyp
of
the
South
ever
made
,
and
come
from
a
yanke
like
me
who
dislik
the
South
that
's
realli
say
someth
.
For
an
establish
,
talent
director
Sam
Raimi
is
unabl
to
provid
ani
kind
of
origin
to
this
film
.
It
's
predict
from
the
first
scene
,
the
screenplay
is
written
like
a
rip-off
of
a
photocopi
bootleg
play
.
you
know
that
as
nasti
as
the
murder
suspect
is
he
did
n't
actual
do
it
.
It
's
no
surpris
either
who
the
real
villain
turn
out
to
be
and
what
their
motiv
was
.
Sigh
,
how
trite
.
For
a
supernatur
thriller
this
is
neither
scari
nor
intens
becaus
it
's
so
clich
.
``
The
Gift
''
is
basic
a
glorifi
b-movi
.
