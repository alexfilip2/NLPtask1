Hollywood
never
fail
to
astound
me
.
Everi
time
I
think
those
coked-up
littl
bugger
have
hit
rock
bottom
;
they
come
up
with
a
new
excav
tool
.
I
was
truli
convinc
that
``
Wild
Wild
West
''
mark
1999
studio
filmmak
at
it
most
hapless
,
but
then
along
come
``
End
of
Day
''
to
prove
me
wrong
.
This
big
budget
,
brain
dead
apocalypt
thriller
bludgeon
it
audienc
with
overwrought
music
,
grisli
violenc
,
explos
galor
and
lot
of
cheesi
special
effect
.
The
result
?
Noth
but
groan
and
yawn
.
Even
the
Devil
himself
is
unabl
to
produc
a
decent
scare
in
this
festiv
of
the
inept
.
At
the
veri
least
,
``
End
of
Day
''
should
have
done
us
the
courtesi
of
be
bad-enough-to-be-good
,
but
it
ca
n't
even
manag
that
.
It
's
just
lousi
.
Arnold
Schwarzenegg
,
still
recov
from
heart
problem
and
``
Batman
&
Robin
,
''
play
an
ex-cop
turn
secur
agent
or
bodyguard
or
someth
.
Along
with
his
obligatori
comic
relief
partner
-LRB-
Kevin
Pollak
,
imperson
Matthew
Perri
's
Chandler
charact
from
``
Friend
''
-RRB-
,
he
get
involv
in
some
major
leagu
supernatur
hoodoo
.
It
seem
that
Satan
-LRB-
Gabriel
Byrn
-RRB-
get
a
shot
at
world
domin
onli
onc
everi
thousand
year
-LRB-
and
here
I
thought
he
'd
pull
it
off
with
the
Republican
landslid
of
'
94
-RRB-
.
If
he
has
sex
with
20-year
old
Christin
york
-LRB-
Robin
Tunney
-RRB-
,
``
the
Chosen
One
,
''
their
child
will
be
the
Antichrist
,
or
at
least
a
brat
.
Ah
,
but
this
deal
has
more
catch
than
a
New
year
's
Eve
pass
from
a
Halfway
Hous
.
The
unholi
union
must
take
place
on
Decemb
31
,
1999
-LRB-
you
see
,
999
is
just
666
turn
upsid
down
-RRB-
,
but
onli
between
11
p.m.
and
Midnight
-LRB-
no
wonder
this
guy
is
so
cranki
-RRB-
.
And
if
the
Chosen
One
is
given
refug
in
a
church
,
the
devil
wo
n't
know
where
she
is
,
becaus
he
ca
n't
see
into
the
sanctuari
.
you
know
,
it
's
kind
of
like
Superman
's
X-ray
vision
and
lead
wall
,
onli
evil
.
A
group
of
guerrilla
Cathol
priest
decid
the
best
way
to
stop
the
situat
is
by
kill
the
girl
.
Arnold
choos
to
save
the
girl
and
kick
the
hell
out
of
Satan
,
if
you
ll
pardon
the
express
.
And
Kevin
meet
up
with
an
explod
van
and
has
to
make
some
decis
of
his
own
.
Oh
,
the
anguish
!
Oh
,
the
human
!
Oh
,
the
write
!
Andrew
W.
Marlow
's
screenplay
ladl
implaus
upon
implaus
,
from
the
preposter
otherworld
histrion
to
his
handl
of
Jericho
Cane
,
Schwarzenegg
's
charact
.
Cane
start
the
film
a
la
Mel
Gibson
in
the
first
``
Lethal
Weapon
,
''
prepar
to
put
a
gun
in
his
mouth
due
to
ongo
despond
over
the
murder
of
his
wife
and
daughter
.
Twenti
minut
later
,
he
's
race
through
the
bowel
of
New
york
Citi
,
deciph
clue
that
Sherlock
Holm
and
Kreskin
would
find
baffl
.
When
Cane
meet
up
with
Christin
york
,
he
instant
switch
to
Termin
father
figur
mode
,
with
the
young
woman
serv
as
surrog
daughter
.
In
case
anyon
miss
the
connect
,
the
camera
come
in
for
a
close
up
of
Christin
's
music
box
,
which
just
happen
to
be
ident
to
one
own
by
Cane
's
daughter
.
Subtl
,
Marlow
,
subtl
.
Speak
of
camera
,
director
Peter
Hyam
is
just
the
man
to
take
Marlow
's
script
and
make
it
even
more
self-import
,
murki
and
annoy
.
Hyam
'
direct
show
all
the
subtleti
of
a
Gwar
video
,
with
Cane
run
a
gauntlet
of
ridicul
action
set
piec
,
punctuat
with
load
of
big
explos
.
Eager
to
satisfi
Arnold
's
core
audienc
,
he
even
throw
in
a
few
pair
of
breast
as
well
.
What
a
guy
.
Had
the
film
deliv
some
decent
scare
,
or
even
maintain
a
consist
omin
tone
,
the
bombast
clich
might
have
been
toler
,
but
``
End
of
Day
''
is
simpli
a
flaccid
special
effect
show
.
The
cast
is
just
as
ineffect
.
In
his
earli
scene
,
Gabriel
Byrn
attempt
to
invest
Beelzebub
with
some
panach
,
but
he
all
too
soon
turn
into
just
anoth
standard
issu
monster
.
Kevin
Pollak
come
and
goe
quick
,
Robin
Tunney
come
off
like
a
bargain
basement
Winona
Ryder
and
as
for
Arnold
,
well
he
's
a
better
actor
than
Casper
Van
Dien
.
That
should
count
for
someth
.
Way
back
in
the
aftermath
``
The
Exorcist
''
and
``
The
Omen
,
''
supernatur
swill
like
``
End
of
Day
''
might
have
pass
muster
as
a
B-movi
.
But
that
was
then
and
this
is
now
.
``
The
X-File
''
and
``
Buffi
the
Vampir
Slayer
''
deliv
real
scare
on
a
week
basi
and
,
if
we
want
to
see
the
Devil
,
all
we
have
to
do
is
flip
on
``
The
700
Club
''
and
take
a
gander
at
Pat
Robertson
's
grin
maw
.
After
endur
``
End
of
Day
,
''
all
I
can
say
is
``
Get
thee
behind
me
,
Satan
.
''
And
while
you
re
at
it
,
get
thee
a
better
agent
as
well
.
