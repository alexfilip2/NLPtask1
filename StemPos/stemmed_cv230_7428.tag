Well
,
I
ll
admit
when
I
first
heard
about
this
film
-LRB-
which
was
befor
Dant
's
Peak
-RRB-
I
could
just
smell
what
`
Twister
'
had
start
.
So
now
it
seem
that
we
re
in
a
full
fledg
return
to
the
'
70
's
disast
film
era
.
With
`
Twister
'
,
`
Dant
's
Peak
'
,
`
Volcano
'
and
soon
`
Flood
'
and
Jame
Cameron
's
extrem
expens
`
Titan
'
I
ll
say
first
off
I
enjoy
`
Volcano
'
much
more
than
I
did
`
Dant
Peak
'
.
Part
of
that
is
just
be
bias
as
I
usual
enjoy
anyth
that
Tommi
Lee
Jone
appear
in
.
I
ve
been
read
a
lot
about
the
movi
be
`
cheezi
'
or
`
hokey
'
and
realli
did
n't
see
or
think
that
onc
dure
the
entir
film
.
I
get
bore
easili
and
this
film
did
n't
bore
me
for
a
minut
.
Another
thing
,
and
boy
am
I
bitch
today
!
,
that
bother
me
is
when
critic
and
such
go
on
about
``
Well
that
not
realli
possibl
.
''
you
know
what
?
I
could
n't
give
a
bloodi
damn
if
it
's
possibl
or
not
,
realli
I
could
n't
.
It
's
a
freak
movi
and
I
do
n't
WANT
realiti
thrown
in
my
face
.
I
want
to
be
abl
to
see
the
imposs
,
the
all
might
``
WHAT
IF
''
to
mani
review
have
seen
one
to
mani
movi
!
The
special
effect
are
the
second
star
to
this
featur
.
They
are
so
amaz
that
I
found
it
hard
sometim
to
believ
they
were
inde
FX
and
LA
was
was
not
burn
to
the
ground
.
They
did
an
incred
job
and
come
Oscar
time
-LRB-
if
they
rememb
-RRB-
some
notic
better
be
thrown
there
way
.
