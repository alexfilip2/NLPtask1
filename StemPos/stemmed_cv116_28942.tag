A
short
punchi
action
sequel
to
the
two
dinosaur
film
made
by
Steven
Spielberg
.
Joe
Johnston
direct
a
straightforward
stori
of
an
excurs
back
to
the
island
of
the
dinosaur
.
It
let
us
see
some
new
dinosaur
-LRB-
is
that
an
oxymoron
?
-RRB-
and
give
us
a
nice
and
general
reason
written
adventur
.
The
film
is
neither
ambiti
nor
pretenti
.
I
had
a
good
time
.
This
is
a
film
on
which
I
expect
to
be
in
a
minor
.
I
like
the
third
JURASSIC
PARK
film
.
I
even
like
the
second
JURASSIC
PARK
film
.
In
a
lot
of
way
JURASSIC
PARK
:
THE
LOST
WORLD
was
a
creativ
three-way
braid
togeth
of
Michael
Crichton
's
novel
THE
LOST
WORLD
,
Arthur
Conan
Doyl
's
novel
THE
LOST
WORLD
,
and
the
classic
silent
film
version
of
the
Doyl
.
JP2
was
an
adventur
,
as
Doyl
said
,
``
for
the
boy
who
's
half
man
or
the
man
who
's
half
boy
.
''
That
is
what
all
the
JURASSIC
PARK
film
are
.
Expect
them
to
give
the
viewer
insight
into
the
human
condit
is
like
expect
your
car
to
vacuum
your
hous
.
The
classic
adventur
film
like
GUNGA
DIN
or
KING
SOLOMON
'S
MINES
had
under-written
charact
also
.
JURASSIC
PARK
III
is
an
all
out
adventur
on
an
island
inhabit
by
dinosaur
.
The
charact
are
a
littl
more
complex
than
they
at
first
appear
to
be
,
and
even
that
is
a
littl
more
complex
than
I
was
expect
.
Some
of
the
charact
who
start
out
look
stupid
and
useless
prove
to
be
neither
as
the
film
proceed
.
That
degre
of
complex
combin
with
those
veri
realist
look
dinosaur
effect
is
just
about
as
much
as
I
requir
.
I
feel
I
got
my
money
's
worth
.
The
stori
open
with
Eric
-LRB-
play
by
Trevor
Morgan
-RRB-
and
friend
parasail
near
the
forbidden
island
of
Isla
Sorna
off
Costa
Rica
.
This
was
the
research
island
where
the
dinosaur
were
creat
for
the
now
defunct
Jurass
Park
.
They
hope
,
no
doubt
,
to
get
a
look
at
the
island
's
dinosaur
from
a
safe
height
.
The
height
is
safe
,
but
drive
the
boat
in
the
water
is
not
.
The
two
soon
find
themselv
in
troubl
and
have
to
ditch
their
parasail
onto
the
island
where
they
do
inde
get
a
better
look
at
the
dinosaur
than
they
had
intend
.
Flash
to
the
Unite
State
and
someon
is
offer
to
fund
paleontologist
Alan
Grant
-LRB-
Sam
Neill
-RRB-
in
his
research
if
he
will
go
and
fli
over
Isla
Sorna
and
act
as
a
guid
.
He
has
said
that
no
forc
on
earth
or
heaven
could
get
him
back
near
real
dinosaur
.
But
again
money
convinc
him
to
drop
what
he
is
do
and
go
.
Do
the
convinc
is
a
wealthi
and
eccentr
coupl
-LRB-
William
H.
Maci
and
Tea
Leoni
-RRB-
who
has
been
just
about
everywher
els
in
the
world
and
want
the
adventur
of
see
real
dinosaur
.
They
too
plan
to
see
the
island
from
a
safe
height
Grant
is
reliev
to
learn
.
He
will
fli
over
this
island
at
a
safe
altitud
just
this
onc
.
Right
.
Guess
what
happen
next
?
JP3
probabl
function
better
as
a
sequel
than
JP2
.
First
it
has
Alan
Grant
and
Ellie
Sattler
-LRB-
Laura
Dern
-RRB-
back
rather
than
the
much
less
appeal
Ian
Malcolm
.
Sattler
has
a
much
smaller
part
in
JP3
,
but
is
still
present
to
tie
this
stori
to
the
first
.
Curious
each
film
seem
to
arrang
to
have
a
signatur
scene
with
charact
hold
on
to
some
larg
metal
object
that
is
about
to
fall
some
great
distanc
.
One
thing
that
doe
not
quit
fit
with
the
earlier
film
is
just
as
Grant
discov
that
raptor
may
be
abl
to
talk
to
each
other
,
sudden
they
seem
to
be
do
it
all
the
time
.
They
did
not
appear
to
be
convers
in
the
previous
film
.
Of
cours
,
these
raptor
look
a
littl
differ
also
,
so
perhap
they
are
a
differ
relat
speci
.
Not
onli
are
they
more
intellig
than
in
the
past
film
,
they
are
also
more
sympathet
.
In
this
stori
they
are
not
just
kill
machin
,
they
have
reason
motiv
for
what
they
do
beyond
nutrit
.
This
time
around
they
may
be
a
littl
too
anthropomorph
.
Each
new
film
in
the
seri
introduc
us
to
some
new
dinosaur
,
of
cours
.
In
this
film
a
major
threat
is
from
a
spinosaurus
,
not
as
common
or
as
popular
known
as
a
Tyrannosaurus
,
but
larger
and
presum
more
nasti
.
It
has
a
crocodil
's
head
and
the
bodi
that
look
like
a
dimetrodon
walk
upright
.
Perhap
as
an
economi
measur
or
just
to
creat
a
mood
the
visual
effect
team
frequent
obscur
our
view
of
the
dinosaur
.
Sometim
they
just
move
too
fast
to
see
.
Occasion
dark
or
fog
obscur
our
vision
.
A
few
time
we
get
unconvinc
matt
shot
,
particular
of
the
laboratori
.
But
there
is
less
money
on
the
screen
in
term
of
dinosaur
effect
than
in
the
two
previous
film
.
The
music
score
by
Don
Davi
borrow
heavili
from
John
William
's
score
for
the
first
film
.
Joe
Johnston
,
who
direct
,
alreadi
has
to
his
credit
two
veri
good
film
I
recommend
THE
ROCKETEER
and
OCTOBER
SKi
.
A
team
includ
Alexand
Payn
and
Jim
Taylor
known
for
ELECTION
write
the
screenplay
.
The
film
they
have
made
is
a
long
way
from
great
cinema
,
but
it
still
is
fun
.
If
you
get
a
thrill
from
see
what
look
veri
much
like
live
dinosaur
aliv
today
,
the
film
is
for
you
.
