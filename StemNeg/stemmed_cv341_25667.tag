you
know
that
a
movi
has
issu
when
most
everyon
in
the
audienc
come
out
laugh
...
and
it
's
not
a
comedi
!
And
what
a
strang
career
path
for
director
Chuck
Russel
.
He
start
his
career
off
with
a
decent
take
on
the
``
Nightmar
on
Elm
Street
''
seri
with
his
debut
as
director
on
instal
number
three
.
He
follow
that
up
with
THE
BLOB
the
veri
next
year
,
but
wait
anoth
six
year
to
do
his
next
piec
,
a
littl
film
call
THE
MASK
star
Jim
Carrey
,
and
then
one
more
star
vehicl
in
ERASER
two
year
after
that
.
So
then
he
thought
,
``
Let
me
wait
anoth
five
year
,
get
a
weak
script
jam
with
clich
and
hope
that
Jimmi
Smit
and
Kim
Basing
could
pull
it
out
of
it
ash
''
?!?
Strang
dude
and
one
crappi
flick
.
A
six-year
old
girl
is
believ
to
be
some
kind
of
mysteri
prophet
sent
down
from
God
.
A
Satan
cult
want
the
girl
to
switch
over
to
their
side
,
while
the
girl
's
aunt
want
to
...
well
,
save
her
from
those
damn
devil
worshipp
!
Enter
one
occult
expert
agent
,
plenti
of
bobo
cop
and
lot
of
nun
pray
,
and
you
ve
just
about
got
the
gist
of
thing
here
.
With
plot
hole
the
size
of
my
ass
,
this
movi
bare
squeez
ani
sens
out
of
it
clich-ridden
plot
,
with
wast
talent
,
cheezi
effect
,
bad
dialogu
and
unintent
laugh
to
boot
.
What
's
good
about
this
movi
?
Well
,
Rufus
Sewel
is
pretti
fun
to
watch
as
the
head
of
a
creepi
runaway
children
's
shelter/Satanist
suprem
,
with
serious
wick
eye
and
just
enough
ham
in
his
perform
to
go
with
all
of
the
chees
lie
around
.
The
littl
girl
is
also
pretti
good
but
unfortun
her
charact
doe
n't
realli
do
all
that
much
.
And
believ
it
or
not
,
I
was
actual
enjoy
some
of
the
film
's
first
half
hour
,
which
start
off
with
some
promis
,
but
not
befor
bonehead
move
after
bonehead
move
from
our
protagonist
,
Basing
,
just
drown
the
film
's
entir
basi
of
believ
.
For
some
reason
,
it
take
her
more
time
than
anyon
to
figur
out
that
her
niec
is
gift
,
and
even
longer
to
figur
out
that
everi
move
that
she
make
...
is
a
dumb
one
!
Add
that
to
the
entir
polic
forc
of
incompet
,
save
for
Jimmi
Smit
-LRB-
whose
talent
agent
advis
him
that
play
the
exact
same
cop
charact
from
NyPD
BLUE
would
be
a
good
career
move
?
At
least
chang
the
cloth
,
Jimmi
!
-RRB-
,
zero
scare
,
zero
thrill
and
even
less
actual
drama
,
and
you
ve
got
yourself
a
pretti
bad
movi
.
And
whi
would
respect
actor
like
Christina
Ricci
and
Ian
Holm
take
bit
part
in
this
movi
?
Did
they
owe
the
director
a
favor
or
someth
?
Togeth
,
they
bare
have
five
minut
of
screen
time
,
but
I
suppos
that
Ricci
's
hospit
room
scene
might
be
worth
a
look
for
some
of
you
horn-dog
.
The
worst
part
about
this
movi
is
it
hilari
unbeliev
end
,
which
featur
polic
offic
come
up
with
the
brilliant
idea
of
``
sneak
up
''
on
a
man
's
hous
,
who
they
know
to
be
guilti
of
a
crime
!
Uuuhmm
...
how
's
about
knock
on
the
door
and
arrest
his
sorri
ass
,
offic
?!
Anyway
,
I
do
n't
usual
inscrib
spoiler
in
my
review
but
the
stupid
of
some
of
these
charact
is
just
too
difficult
to
describ
without
valid
it
with
solid
idiot
proof
-LRB-
and
there
was
plenti
to
go
around
-RRB-
.
And
did
Basing
lose
some
of
her
act
``
talent
''
dure
her
hiatus
from
the
profess
after
her
1997
Oscar
win
?
Difficult
to
say
if
it
was
her
line
that
were
realli
bad
,
or
if
she
just
deliv
them
poor
.
Either
way
,
littl
origin
,
veri
obvious
comput
effect
,
littl
thrill
,
littl
drama
and
veri
littl
entertain
valu
,
certain
bestow
the
honor
of
one
of
the
worst
movi
of
the
summer
upon
this
film
.
But
if
you
realli
do
n't
mind
a
rehash
gobbledygook
of
various
Satan
and
``
kid
''
-
base
thriller
,
and
enjoy
watch
film
that
do
n't
bring
anyth
new
to
the
tabl
...
well
,
drink
some
beer
,
smoke
some
bean
and
rent
this
video
,
becaus
it
may
just
be
one
of
the
funnier
thriller
of
the
year
.
