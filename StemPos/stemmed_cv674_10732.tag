Look
back
at
all
the
time
in
your
life
when
there
was
a
fork
in
the
path
to
the
futur
.
Some
sort
of
decis
had
to
be
made
,
and
,
for
better
or
wors
,
it
irrevoc
alter
the
cours
of
your
exist
.
From
time-to-tim
,
everyon
think
about
the
road
not
taken
,
and
how
thing
might
have
turn
out
if
the
choic
had
been
differ
.
Perhap
even
more
dizzi
to
contempl
is
how
a
seem
minor
action
--
catch
the
10
am
train
,
for
exampl
--
could
have
an
equal
profound
,
yet
less
obvious
,
impact
.
Mayb
that
's
where
you
met
your
signific
other
,
and
,
had
you
reach
the
platform
just
a
few
second
later
Film
maker
are
no
less
fascin
by
issu
of
destini
than
anyon
els
,
and
that
's
whi
there
's
no
shortag
of
movi
about
this
subject
.
The
best
of
the
bunch
were
probabl
made
by
the
late
Polish
director
Krzysztof
Kieslowski
,
who
was
obsess
with
question
of
fate
and
chanc
.
These
theme
weav
their
way
through
mani
of
his
movi
,
includ
DECALOGUE
,
THE
DOUBLE
LIFE
OF
VERONIQUE
,
and
the
triptych
of
BLUE
,
WHITE
,
and
RED
.
Howev
,
they
are
most
explicit
examin
in
a
1981
film
call
BLIND
CHANCE
,
where
Kieslowski
present
the
three
differ
fate
of
one
man
after
a
minor
action
-LRB-
miss
or
catch
a
train
-RRB-
chang
the
cours
of
his
life
.
In
his
autobiographi
,
KIESLOWSKI
ON
KIESLOWSKI
,
the
director
describ
his
attract
to
the
concept
this
way
:
''
-LSB-
The
idea
is
-RSB-
rich
and
interest
that
everi
day
we
re
face
with
a
choic
which
could
end
our
entir
life
yet
of
which
we
re
complet
unawar
.
''
While
this
approach
has
been
the
fodder
for
sever
notabl
dramat
film
-LRB-
includ
,
in
a
way
,
Frank
Capra
's
IT
'S
A
WONDERFUL
LIFE
-RRB-
,
SLIDING
DOORS
is
the
first
romant
comedi
to
plumb
it
depth
.
The
``
road
not
taken
''
approach
is
n't
just
a
plot
devic
,
either
.
Writer/director
Peter
Howitt
expand
upon
both
possibl
fate
of
a
charact
after

life
:
her
futur
career
,
where
she

whom
she

and
whether
she
has
a

As
her
separ
destini
diverg
and
then
re-converg
,
she
becom
two
complet
differ
individu

That
woman
is
Helen
,
play
by
Gwyneth
Paltrow
as
a
long

dark-hair
Brit
.
One
day
,
after
lose
her
job
as
an
advertis
execut
,
she
decid
to
return
home
in
the
middl
of
the
day
.
The
scene
of
the
pivot
moment
is
a
train
platform
.
In
scenario
#
1
,
she
just
slip
through
the
slide
door
befor
the
train
pull
out
of
the
station
.
On
board
,
she
meet
the
cheer

talkat
Jame
-LRB-
John
Hannah
-RRB-
,
a
MONTi
PyTHON

who
is

Minut

in

she

In

she
miss
the

and
,
short
thereaft
,
is
the
victim
of
an
attempt

.
She
doe
n't
meet
Jame
and
fail
to
make
it
home
in
time
to
discov
Gerri

infidel
.
Juxtapos
one
against
the
other
,
while
share
mani
place
,
cue
,
and
charact
,
the
two
stori
proceed
in
parallel
from
there
.
On
one
level
,
for
viewer
who
enjoy
ponder
the
work
of
fate
,
SLIDING
DOORS
can
be
view
as
a
deep
and
wonder
experi
.
But
,
for
those
who
just
appreci
a
romant
comedi
character
by
solid
act
,
a
script
with
a
few
twist
,
and
a
great
deal
of
genuin
funni
materi
,
SLIDING
DOORS
still
fit
the
bill
.
One
of
it
most
obvious
strength
is
that
it
can
satisfi
mani
differ
type
of
audienc
--
those
who
demand
someth
substanti
from
their
motion
pictur
,
and
those
who
could
care
less
.
It
should
n't
come
as
ani
surpris
that
the
act
,
at
least
from
three
of
the
four
lead
,
is
solid
.
Paltrow
,
who
doe
doubl
duti
as
two
Helen
who
are
initi
the
same
,
yet
gradual
becom
much
differ
,
is
the
standout
.
She
play
both
of
her
role
effect
and
believ
--
the
shi
,
insecur
woman
who
stay
with
Gerri
and
the
liber
,
platinum-blond
who
sever
the
tie
to
her
old
life
and
embark
on
a
new
career
with
a
new
man
.
John
Hannah
,
known
to
most
American
viewer
as
the
younger
gay
charact
in
FOUR
WEDDINGS
AND
A
FUNERAL
,
is
instant
likabl
.
John
Lynch
,
take
a
break
from
movi
about
Ireland
's
troubl
,
doe
a
good
job
present
Gerri
as
a
inept
,
selfish
philander
.
Onli
Jeann
Tripplehorn
,
who
play
an
over-the-top
vixen
,
seem
out
of
place
.
Her
attempt
at
broad
comedi
are
occasion
jar
,
and
it
's
occasion
difficult
to
see
her
Lydia
as
anyth
more
than
a
plot
element
.
One
member
of
the
support
cast
deserv
special
notic
.
Dougla
McFerran
,
who
play
Gerri
's
best
friend
,
Russel
,
is
an
absolut
delight
,
steal
everi
scene
that
he
's
in
.
Part
of
this
is
sure
becaus
he
is
given
the
best
line
in
the
movi
.
On
one
occas
,
he
has
a
marvel
monologu
bemoan
how
advanc
in
the
telecommun
industri
have
trap
men
into
a
life
of
monogami
.
On
anoth
occas
,
while
laugh
at
Gerri
's
plight
with
the
women
in
his
life
,
he
comment
,
``
Be
with
you
make
the
wait
for
the
next
episod
of
SEINFELD
more
bearabl
.
''
But
it
's
not
all
in
the
dialogu
.
McFerran
tear
into
this
part
with
relish
;
his
perform
becom
one
of
the
most
memor
aspect
of
a
top-notch
comedi
.
This
is
the
first
featur
film
for
Peter
Howitt
,
and
he
approach
the
task
with
unimpeach
aplomb
.
The
script
is
shrewd
and
invent
,
combin
wit
,
romanc
,
and
intellig
melodrama
into
a
crowd-pleas
whole
.
SLIDING
DOORS
grant
more
than
just
a
good
time
at
the
movi
,
howev
.
For
those
who
are
so
inclin
,
it
central
theme
offer
an
opportun
to
ponder
some
of
the
more
philosoph
question
about
the
work
of
the
univers
--
all
while
have
a
good
time
.
