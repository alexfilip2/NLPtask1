The
1998
Summer
Movi
Season
is
still
in
it
infanc
.
But
after
diasappoint
film
such
as
``
Godzilla
''
and
``
Fear
And
Loath
In
Las
Vega
''
,
it
would
be
nice
to
see
a
realli
good
film
.
But
I
doubt
you
could
have
expect
this
.
The
Truman
show
is
one
of
the
most
uniqu
film
I
have
ever
seen
,
and
it
deserv
a
spot
on
the
``
Decad
's
Best
''
list
.
There
is
no
way
to
isol
ani
singl
compon
of
this
pictur
and
proclaim
,
``
yes
,
THAT
'S
what
make
this
film
great
.
''
The
blend
of
Peter
Weir
's
master
-LRB-
and
in
mani
way
brilliant
-RRB-
direct
,
Peter
Biziou
's
stun
photographi
and
Jim
Carrey
's
perform
is
what
make
this
film
work
so
fantast
.
There
is
someth
strang
beauti
about
everi
shot
in
The
Truman
Show
.
It
may
be
the
use
of
color
or
the
placement
of
charact
in
the
frame
,
but
everyth
about
this
film
look
intent
and
perfect
.
Carrey
has
made
a
veri
wise
choic
.
By
play
mild-mann
Truman
Burbank
,
he
allow
himself
enough
room
to
be
comic
,
and
therefor
not
alien
his
true
fan
,
while
still
show
a
vulner
and
human
side
.
That
is
a
side
which
has
been
miss
from
near
everi
major
charact
he
has
play
in
his
numer
commerci
success
.
Truman
Burbank
was
born
to
an
audienc
of
million
.
He
was
chosen
befor
birth
to
be
the
focus
of
ahour
televis
show
.
Everyth
in
his
environ
is
control
by
a
team
of
technician
,
led
by
the
show
's
director
,
Christof
-LRB-
play
by
Ed
Harri
-RRB-
.
Everyon
in
Truman
's
life
is
an
actor
or
an
extra
.
They
are
all
be
watch
by
million
of
peopl
around
the
globe
,
peopl
who
can
tune
in
at
ani
time
of
the
day
to
see
what
is
happen
in
Truman
's
life
.
But
he
is
the
onli
person
that
is
not
awar
of
it
.
The
classif
of
The
Truman
Show
may
be
tricki
.
The
audienc
react
to
mani
of
Truman
's
revel
with
laughter
.
I
did
not
laugh
much
dure
the
film
becaus
I
was
so
emot
wrap
up
with
the
charact
.
The
thing
that
made
the
audienc
laugh
gave
me
glassi
eye
,
becaus
what
was
happen
to
him
,
inde
what
had
been
done
to
him
his
whole
life
was
wrong
.
So
is
this
go
to
end
up
label
as
a
comedi
?
A
drama
?
It
realli
depend
on
the
audienc
.
But
to
me
,
The
Truman
Show
was
a
touch
,
sad
tale
about
the
extent
to
which
a
corpor
will
go
to
exploit
human
life
for
the
entertain
of
other
.
But
abov
all
els
,
The
Truman
Show
was
a
stun
beauti
pictur
with
humor
,
heart
and
scari
realism
.
Oscar
predict
in
June
are
pointless
,
but
if
The
Truman
Show
had
been
releas
on
schedul
in
late
fall
or
winter
of
1997
,
as
origin
plan
,
Jame
Cameron
would
be
Oscar-less
.
