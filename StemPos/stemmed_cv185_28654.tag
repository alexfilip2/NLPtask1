Jet
Li
is
a
Chines
cop
ask
to
help
some
French
policemen
nab
a
bad
guy
.
But
one
thing
lead
to
anoth
,
and
the
next
thing
you
know
,
Li
's
be
chase
by
the
same
French
cop
with
whom
he
was
suppos
to
be
work
.
A
lot
of
ass-kick
,
face-whip
,
gun
fight
and
...
okay
,
a
littl
more
ass-kick
ensu
.
CRITIQUE
:
Veri
cool
!
Now
here
's
a
movi
that
give
you
exact
what
you
re
look
for
,
if
what
you
re
look
for
is
kickass
action
,
a
palpabl
good
cop/bad
cop
stori
line
,
some
hardcor
stunt
and
Jet
Li
slam-dunk
everyon
in
sight
!
The
film
also
move
fast
-LRB-
a
mere
95
minut
-RRB-
,
develop
a
certain
``
cute
''
chemistri
between
Fonda
and
Li
,
has
nice
surround
-LRB-
Pari
,
babi
!
-RRB-
and
give
us
one
of
the
best
bad
guy
that
I
ve
seen
all
year
.
Tcheki
Karyo
is
the
devil
incarn
in
this
film
.
He
is
pure
evil
.
They
should
have
call
this
movi
BAD
LIEUTENANT
2
as
Keitel
has
noth
on
this
man
.
What
a
great
,
great
monster
!
My
favorit
line
of
Tcheki
's
was
when
Li
was
explain
the
whole
``
kiss
of
the
dragon
''
thing
to
him
and
he
cut
him
off
by
say
``
kiss
my
ass
!
''
Pure
action
movi
poetri
.
Anyway
,
other
than
him
,
Jet
Li
also
handl
his
``
act
''
pretti
well
in
this
film
,
with
veri
littl
real
dialogu
to
say
,
but
enough
to
make
us
believ
his
charact
.
Actualli
,
just
look
into
the
man
's
eye
general
tell
you
a
lot
.
Fonda
was
also
pretti
good
,
despit
play
one
of
the
most
trashi
and
abus
women
that
I
have
seen
in
quit
some
time
,
but
I
still
felt
kinda
bad
for
her
,
so
I
guess
she
did
her
job
okay
.
But
in
the
end
,
nobodi
goe
to
see
this
kind
of
movi
for
Oscar
perform
.
We
go
to
see
Jet
Li
movi
becaus
we
want
to
see
Jet
Li
kick
a
lot
of
ass
from
side
to
side
,
and
this
film
deliv
gangbust
on
that
front
.
And
yes
...
they
have
no
wire-fu
in
this
movi
...
I
say
again
...
no
wire-work
,
no
bullshit
stunt
with
Li
float
around
in
mid-air
for
over
a
minut
.
It
's
all
straight
action
,
fist
to
fist
,
boot
to
face
and
all
around
cool
stunt
.
If
that
's
what
you
re
look
for
,
I
do
n't
see
how
you
will
be
disappoint
with
this
film
.
yes
,
it
's
not
veri
origin
in
plot
-LRB-
just
take
Luc
Besson
's
own
LA
FEMME
NIKITA
and
mix
in
plenti
of
his
own
THE
PROFESSIONAL
et
voila
!
-RRB-
,
doe
have
an
annoy
hip-hoppi
soundtrack
that
just
got
on
my
nerv
after
a
while
-LRB-
I
also
would
have
gotten
rid
of
the
whole
acupunctur
thang
...
-RRB-
and
will
have
anyon
not
will
to
restrain
their
disbelief
,
roll
their
eye
all
over
the
place
.
But
was
I
entertain
?
Thorough
.
Doe
the
film
featur
more
gunplay
,
martial
art
and
over-the-top
kill
that
most
recent
action
flick
?
yes
,
again
.
Doe
this
sound
interest
to
you
?
Well
,
the
answer
to
that
question
is
entir
up
to
you
.
One
thing
that
I
would
definit
recommend
is
,
as
Jet
Li
point
out
himself
on
his
websit
,
that
you
leav
the
kid
at
home
for
this
one
.
In
fact
,
you
might
even
wan
na
leav
yourself
if
you
ca
n't
handl
the
more
violent
of
sequenc
.
All
in
all
,
a
rippin
'
,
roarin
'
fun
time
!
