It
is
with
some
sad
ironi
that
I
screen
Fright
Night
Parton
the
day
that
one
of
it
's
star
,
Roddi
McDowal
pass
away
at
the
age
of
70
.
McDowal
was
one
of
the
most
talent
and
prolif
actor
in
Hollywood
,
have
a
career
that
span
overyear
and
appear
in
more
than
100
film
.
Fright
Night
Partprob
will
not
be
count
among
his
more
memor
role
.
This
is
realli
sad
consid
how
good
the
first
Fright
Night
film
was
.
William
Ragsdal
and
Roddi
McDowal
both
repris
their
role
as
the
somewhat
reluct
vampir
killer
who
seem
to
be
the
onli
one
that
realiz
that
vampir
walk
among
us
.
-LRB-
At
least
in
the
movi
anyway
.
-RRB-
It
has
been
sever
year
sinc
Charli
Brewster
-LRB-
Ragsdal
-RRB-
and
B-movi
actor
turn
late
night
horror
film
host
,
Peter
Vincent
-LRB-
McDowal
-RRB-
came
face
to
face
with
a
real
live
vampir
who
just
happen
to
be
Charli
's
next
door
neighbor
.
Charli
and
Peter
won
that
battl
,
but
appar
even
vampir
have
relat
who
get
piss
if
you
kill
member
of
their
famili
.
Apparent
Charli
's
former
bloodsuck
next
door
neighbor
had
a
sister
who
was
none
too
pleas
to
find
out
that
some
kid
and
an
age
actor
stake
her
sibl
.
So
she
decid
to
exact
a
littl
bit
of
reveng
.
This
end
up
forc
Charli
and
Peter
to
battl
the
forc
of
dark
yet
again
.
One
of
the
thing
that
made
Fright
Night
such
a
success
was
Chris
Sarandon
who
play
Charli
's
stylish
next
door
neighbor
with
a
tast
for
blood
.
Fright
Night
Parttri
to
duplic
that
modern
style
but
it
fall
sort
.
While
they
are
stylish
,
the
vamp
in
this
film
just
do
n't
have
the
person
of
the
undead
in
the
first
film
.
With
the
except
of
a
werewolf
who
add
some
much
need
comic
relief
to
a
few
of
the
scene
.
One
bright
spot
,
speak
from
a
strict
sexist
point
of
view
,
is
Traci
Lin
,
who
play
Charli
's
veri
skeptic
girlfriend
.
It
's
realli
a
shame
that
her
career
has
n't
been
better
sinc
she
made
this
film
.
Ragsdal
doe
a
fair
job
in
this
film
,
but
doe
n't
give
near
the
perform
that
he
did
in
the
origin
.
Roddi
McDowal
make
the
most
with
what
he
is
given
,
which
unfortun
is
n't
much
which
is
a
shame
becaus
his
charact
was
a
lot
of
fun
in
the
origin
movi
.
I
guess
I
would
have
to
say
that
the
first
film
was
a
superior
product
in
everi
way
.
The
origin
alway
left
you
feel
danger
was
lurk
right
around
the
corner
,
Parthad
more
of
the
feel
of
a
music
video
.
Never
a
good
thing
for
a
horror
film
.
Another
minus
for
Partwa
the
tradit
scene
that
leav
the
audienc
on
the
edg
of
their
seat
wait
for
someth
to
jump
out
of
a
shadow
where
veri
rare
.
For
that
matter
,
they
were
almost
nonexist
.
If
I
was
go
to
watch
a
horror
film
,
this
would
be
far
from
my
first
choic
.
The
first
Fright
Night
,
on
the
other
hand
,
would
be
right
up
near
the
top
of
my
list
.
If
I
was
in
the
mood
for
a
Roddi
McDowal
film
I
'd
probabl
head
to
the
scienc
fiction
section
of
my
local
video
store
and
rent
Planet
Of
The
Apes
.
Either
way
Fright
Night
Partwould
most
like
not
enter
into
the
equat
.
