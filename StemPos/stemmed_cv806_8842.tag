The
year
is
2023
,
and
New
york
is
the
citi
.
The
onli
basic
differ
between
Besson
's
futurist

the
real
life
New
york
is
that
the
smog
is
thicker
,
the
build

Anyway

the

In

by
fighter
pod
and
is
destroy
befor
land
.
When
offici
arriv
at
the
site
,
all
that
remain
is
a
hand
.
What
can
you
do
with
a
hand
?
Hey
,
it
the
21st
Centuri
here-DNA
reconstruct
!
This
hand
turn
out
to
belong
to
a
beauti
,
but
mysteri
woman
name
Leeloo
-LRB-
Milla
Jovovich
,
Daze
and
Confus
-RRB-
.
She
escap
and
,
attempt
to
escap
the
polic
by
swan
dive
off
of
an
enorm
skyscrap
and
crash
through
the
roof
of
Korben
's
float
cab
.
It
's
love
at
first
site
,
as
Korben
and
Leeloo
elud
the
lazy-as-alway
cop
.
When
Leeloo

Night

on
Manhattan
-RRB-
,
Korben
search
the
``

and
deliv
her
to
the
door
of
the
good
reverend
,
the
onli
man
who
know
of
her
background
and
duti
.
Now
,
Korben
,
Leeloo
,
and
Cornelius
must
journey
to
a
foreign
planet
to
board
a
cruis
ship
-LRB-
special
effect
were
spectacular
here
-RRB-
to
find
the
remain
four
element
.
It
is
here
,
where
they
discov
that
they
have
been

Jean-Baptist
Emmanuel
Zorg
-LRB-
Gari
Oldman
,
Murder

He
,
too
,
want
possess
of
the
element
,
as
do
a

out
,
Leeloo
is
face
with
a
problem-whi
should
she
save
a
peopl
who
live
to
destroy
each
other
?
The
question
is
a
good
one
,
and
one
that
could
be
ponder
.
But
enough
of
that
.
When
Korben
point
out
his
love
for
her
,
Leeloo
is
inclin
to
becom
the
``
5th
element
''
and
save
the
world
from
total
destruct
.
The
Fifth
Element
featur
good
perform
by
Willi
and
Holm
,
an
excel
portray
of
a
comed
villain
-LRB-
who
remind
me
a
lot
of
Jack
Nicholson
's
The
Joker
in
Batman
-RRB-
by
one
of
the
master
of
villaini
,
Oldman
,
and
a
heartfelt
offer
by
relat
newcom
Jovovich
.
The
support
cast
,
which
includ
Brion
Jame
-LRB-
Tango
&
Cash
-RRB-
,
Tim
``
Tini
''
Lester
-LRB-
No
Hold
Bar
-RRB-
,
Luke
Perri
-LRB-
Buffi
the
Vampir
Slayer
-RRB-
,
and
Chris
Tucker
-LRB-
Friday
-RRB-
,
ad
a
comed
effect
to
the
film
.
Although
Besson
's
The
Fifth
Element
can
be
critic
for
the
outlandish
use
of
clich
,
it
is
a
solid
motion
pictur
with
a
definit
point
.
Some
other
director
-LRB-
like
Anaconda
's
Lui
Llosa
-RRB-
should
take
a
lesson
from
this
guy-us
idea
from
epic
motion
pictur
the
right
way
.
Idea
from
Star
War
and
Stargat
were
util
for
the
improv
of
this
film
.
Sci-fi
fan
or
not
,
ani
movie-lov
should
see
this
wonder
stylish
motion
pictur
.
