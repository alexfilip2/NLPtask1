Numer
comparison
can
be
made
with
this
movi
to
past
sci-fi
,
suspens
thriller
.
Soldier
is
a
multicrossbre
between
the
like
of
Termin
,
Alien
and
offspr
.
The
problem
with
such
mix
gene
is
that
the
final
product
is
a
real
mongrel
not
well
made
and
should
have
been
put
down
befor
product
got
off
the
ground
.
Besid
this
,
the
action
is
mediocr
when
compar
to
the
standard
action
flick
of
this
day
and
age
.
The
fight
scene
between
Jason
Scott
Lee
and
Kurt
Russel
seem
labour
,
slow
and
sluggish
,
and
could
have
done
with
better
choreographi
.
Russel
who
is
usual
a
good
actor
in
B-Grade
action
flick
is
unusu
hamper
by
his
charact
Sergeant
Todd
,
who
seem
more
like
a
Sergeant
Toad
.
Besid
have
almost
no
dialogu
,
his
charact
appear
stunt
,
zombie-lik
which
is
in
line
with
his
screen
persona
,
but
score
littl
point
of
empathi
with
the
audienc
.
This
movi
has
not
made
me
chang
my
opinion
about
director
Paul
Anderson
,
whose
last
epic
Event
Horizon
has
left
an
unusu
bitter
tast
in
my
mouth
.
Although
this
movi
doe
not
come
anywher
close
to
the
strang
of
former
,
it
is
still
a
long
way
from
anyth
consid
desir
.
