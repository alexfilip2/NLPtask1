I
must
admit
I
'm
go
to
be
a
bit
bias
in
my
review
of
the
new
romant
comedi
Serendip
,
becaus
that
also
defin
how
I
met
my
current
girlfriend
.
The
magic
and
mysteri
of
our
fate
encount
is
also
embodi
in
the
quirki
and
fresh
of
the
veri
funni
and
veri
romant
Serendip
.
I
am
not
a
big
fan
of
the
romant
comedi
genr
,
but
someth
drew
me
to
this
film
.
Mayb
it
was
the
cast
of
the
underr
Jeremi
Piven
in
a
support
role
,
and
the
hilari
Eugen
Levi
.
Mayb
it
was
my
hope
that
John
Cusack
would
get
the
redempt
he
just
deserv
after
such
crap
as
High
Fidel
,
Con
Air
,
and
Push
Tin
.
But
mayb
it
was
becaus
I
feel
as
giddi
as
a
school
kid
right
now
with
this
whole
romant
thing
current
in
my
life
.
The
