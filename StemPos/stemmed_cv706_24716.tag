up
with
bandit
Roy
O'Bannon
-LRB-
Owen
Wilson
-RRB-

He

than
he
is
a
glori
hog
,
look
simpl
for
the
notorieti
and
fame
that

an
Indian

-LRB-
Brandon
Merril
-RRB-
,
befor
onc
again
run
into
Roy
.
``
Shanghai
Noon
''
is
just
good
fun
.
The
chemistri
between
the
cast
is
remark
.
The
perform
are
all
accept
within
the
whimsic
level
of
the
film
.
Jacki
's
perform
is
as
good
as
anyth
he
's
done
befor
.
He
's
not
call
on
to
do
much
act
here
,
as
the
charact
is
not
written
with
ani
depth
.
But
Jacki
's
natur
charisma
shine
through
,
and
his
comic
time
is
so
perfect
,
both
physic
and
-LRB-
surpris
-RRB-
verbal
that
onc
again
he
command
the
screen
whenev
he
is
on
.
Owen
Wilson
,
last
seen
in
the
embarrass
remak
of
``
The
Haunt
''
,
give
a
good
natur
perform
as
Roy
O'Bannon
.
His
innoc
is
refresh
and
fun
.
A
bad
guy
that
's
not
realli
bad
.
His
scene
with
Jacki
are
some
of
the
best
bit
of
comic
duel
sinc
Martin
and
Lewi
.
Luci
Liu
as
Princess
Pei
Pei
is
given
littl
to
do
in
the
script
,
but
for
a
chang
doe
not
play
a
nymphet
or
some
other
deviant
.
The
charact
is
a
nobl
woman
of
status
and
wealth
,
but
find
a
greater
caus
as
a
result
of
her
own
imprison
.
The
rest
of
the
perform
are
all
broad
drawn
comic
perform
.
Noth
here
is
realist
,
mind
you
.
``
Shanghai
Noon
''
is
first
and
foremost
a
light
,
jovial
film
.
And
the
perform
match
that
style
with
eas
.
The
Cinematographi
by
Dan
Mindel
is
gorgeous
.
Using
Calgari
,
Alberta
as
the
prime
locat
.
Mr.
Mindel
is
abl
to
creat
a
lush
,
romant
western
feel
to
the
film
.
Noth
here
realli
look
like
Nevada
,
but
the
locat
are
so
beauti
shot
and
stage
,
the
film
can
be
look
upon
as
a
love
tribut
to
earlier
film
of
the
genr
.
And
as
such
,
the
script
by
Alfred
Gough
and
Mile
Millar
play
fast
and
loos
with
histori
,
but
with
rever
to
past
film
.
Homag
to
such
film
as
``
High
Noon
''
-LRB-
obvious
-RRB-
,
``
Red
River
''
and
most
notabl
``
Butch
Cassidi
&
the
Sundanc
Kid
''
all
bring
a
sens
of
nostalgia
to
the
film
.
It
is
a
comfort
experi
.
At
a
time
when
the
Western
is
consid
either
old
hat
or
irrelev
,
here
is
a
film
that
embrac
those
old
attitud
and
-LRB-
dare
I
say
-RRB-
cliché
and
manag
to
make
them
palat
and
refresh
.
Here
is
a
film
that
is
not
contemptu
of
the
genr
.
This
is
the
purest
``
hors
opera
''
sinc
the
day
of
Georg
O'Brian
or
John
Wayn
.
Director
Tom
Dey
has
craft
a
love
tribut
to
Hollywood
's
past
.
In
this
,
his
first
film
Mr.
Dey
show
both
a
love
of
charact
and
of
craftsmanship
that
is
refresh
to
see
.
Noth
here
realli
stand
out
,
or
take
one
's
attent
away
from
the
stori
or
action
.
And
that
is
as
it
should
be
,
when
Jacki
Chan
is
your
star
.
And
what
of
the
action
and
stunt
.
Well
,
while
not
up
to
a
level
of
``
Drunken
Master
2
''
or
ani
of
Jacki
's
Hong
Kong
film
,
``
Shanghai
Noon
''
is
mile
ahead
of
anyth
Jacki
has
done
in
an
American
film
befor
.
His
time
,
choreographi
,
and
creativ
are
still
as
sharp
as
ever
.
Jacki
even
get
to
recreat
a
few
scene
from
his
earlier
film
-LRB-
obvious
to
those
of
us
that
have
seen
those
film
,
but
refresh
fun
for
those
unfamiliar
-RRB-
.
Final
Jacki
can
honest
say
,
that
he
has
made
an
U.S.
,
his
way
and
incorpor
his
style
.
To
sum
up
,
``
Shanghai
Noon
''
is
a
fun
summer
confect
.
Not
too
heavi
and
not
too
light
.
A
fun
and
entertain
film
that
the
whole
famili
can
enjoy
-LRB-
parent
be
advis
there
are
scene
of
smoke
,
drunken
and
peyot
use
-RRB-
.
An
enjoy
and
charm
film
that
can
and
will
be
enjoy
again
and
again
.
