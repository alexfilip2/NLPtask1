The
question
is
n't
whi
has
Greas
been
reissu
.
The
answer
to
that
one
is
easi
:
To
celebr
the
movi
's
20th
anniversari
and
to
make
more
buck
for
Paramount
's
coffer
becaus
John
Travolta
is
onc
again
a
hot
commod
.
No
,
the
question
that
ought
to
be
ask
is
:
Should
Greas
be
reissu
?
Greas
is
a
fun
movi
,
an
entertain
fantasi
of
the
50s
,
embodi
all
the
clich
of
that
era
.
The
music
is
live
and
the
danc
number
,
choreograph
by
Patricia
Birch
,
are
energet
and
high-spirit
.
Travolta
was
at
his
pinnacl
as
a
sexual
icon
,
cool
,
but
non-threaten
.
But
Greas
did
n't
break
ani
new
cinemat
ground
.
It
was
not
a
mileston
in
movi
histori
such
as
Citizen
Kane
or
Easi
Rider
.
What
Greas
is-or
has
become-i
the
highest-gross
music
in
film
histori
.
OK
,
let
's
not
be
a
spoilsport
.
Greas
is
a
fun
and
entertain
movi
,
even
though
it
stretch
credul
to
see
such
perform
as
Travolta
,
Olivia
Newton-John
,
Taxi
's
Jeff
Conaway
and
the
multi-tal
Stockard
Chan
tri
to
act
like
high
schooler
.
It
's
nostalg
to
recal
how
good
a
dancer
Travolta
was
,
and
it
's
sad
to
think
of
what
could
have
been
had
not
a
few
misstep
sidetrack
his
career
.
He
could
have
becom
a
music
comedi
star
in
the
tradit
of
Gene
Kelli
.
Cinemat
,
the
music
comedi
has
basic
gone
the
way
of
the
dinosaur
.
Between
Greas
and
1996
's
Evita.
,
you
can
probabl
count
the
number
of
movi
music
on
one
hand
.
Two
reason
have
contribut
to
the
demis
of
the
genr
:
The
first
is
that
movi
audienc
have
becom
more
sophist
,
no
,
make
that
cynic
and
jade
.
Today
,
if
a
charact
began
to
danc
and
sing
with
no
orchestra
in
sight
,
he
or
she
would
probabl
be
hoot
off
the
screen
.
Today
's
audienc
lack
the
innoc
,
that
belief
in
movi
magic
that
is
requir
for
a
music
to
succeed
.
Second
,
a
lack
of
talent
.
Perform
with
the
charisma
,
the
style
,
the
larger-than-lif
panach
of
Fred
Astair
,
Gene
Kelli
,
Ginger
Roger
and
Judi
Garland
are
gone
.
Most
singer
and
dancer
remain
on
the
stage
,
and
those
who
do
succeed
in
movi
usual
wind
up
in
serious
dramat
part
.
A
good
exampl
is
Gregori
Hine
,
one
of
the
greatest
dancer
in
the
world
.
He
danc
a
bit
in
The
Cotton
Club
,
Tap
and
White
Night
,
but
those
were
essenti
dramat
vehicl
.
So
,
perhap
the
reissu
of
Greas
can
serv
a
purpos
.
If
audienc
show
enough
interest
,
mean
if
the
re-releas
earn
the
studio
enough
revenu
,
it
may
spark
a
reviv
in
movi
music
.
Perhap
not
origin
music
such
as
Singin
'
in
the
Rain
,
An
American
in
Pari
or
Seven
Bride
for
Seven
Brother
,
but
for
Broadway
properti
that
have
been
in
the
plan
stage
for
film
adapt
for
sever
year
.
At
one
time
or
anoth
,
accord
to
the
industri
rumor
mill
,
Hollywood
has
been
set
to
creat
an
anim
version
of
Andrew
Lloyd
Webber
's
Cat
,
a
film
of
the
popular
Phantom
of
the
Opera
as
well
as
Les
Miser
and
Chicago
,
the
latter
report
to
star
Madonna
.
So
,
let
this
Greas
be
the
forerunn
of
an
armada
of
movi
music
.
Let
Greas
be
the
word
that
spark
this
reviv
.
