I
did
n't
realli
expect
veri
much
when
I
rent
Stuart
Save
His
Famili
.
The
movi
bomb
at
the
box
offic
,
and
I
had
never
realli
like
the
Saturday
Night
Live
sketch
on
which
the
movi
was
base
.
My
real
concern
,
though
,
was
the
general
reput
of
SNL-relat
movi
translat
to
the
big
screen
with
less-than-stellar
result
-LRB-
Half-Bak
,
anyon
?
-RRB-
I
was
surpris
to
discov
a
truli
entertain
,
often
hilari
yet
also
touch
littl
film
.
It
is
an
Al
Franken
product
through-and-through
,
who
not
onli
creat
the
titl
charact
but
also
wrote
and
star
in
the
pictur
.
For
those
of
you
who
do
n't
know
,
Al
Franken
play
a
guy
name
Stuart
Smalley
,
who
has
a
realli
annoy
show
on
a
public-access
station
about
increas
your
self-esteem
,
etc.
.
Although
not
a
licens
therapist
,
Stuart
Smalley
is
,
as
the
program
proud
boast
,
``
a
graduat
of
sever
12-step
program
.
''
Stuart
is
do
well
enough
with
his
tv
show
,
but
he
keep
get
distract
by
famili
troubl
.
Stuart
's
relat
are
a
mess
:
his
dad
and
brother
-LRB-
Harri
yulin
and
Vincent
D'Onofrio
,
respect
-RRB-
are
alcohol
,
his
sister
is
overweight
and
get
over
anoth
divorc
,
and
his
mom
is
in
constant
self-deni
and
solv
all
perceiv
problem
by
bake
.
Then
,
disast
strike
.
Stuart
accident
insult
the
manag
of
the
station
and
get
his
show
revok
.
He
is
forc
to
move
back
in
with
his
famili
after
he
can
no
longer
support
himself
,
and
there
the
comedi
truli
pick
up
.
Franken
wrote
all
of
the
charact
not
just
as
clich
or
stereotyp
,
but
as
sharply-drawn
,
real
peopl
.
Although
Smalley
's
dad
has
alway
imbib
too
much
,
Stuart
can
still
recal
time
when
his
father
seem
like
an
okay
guy
.
Also
,
after
an
accid
toward
the
end
of
the
movi
,
both
Stuart
and
the
audienc
learn
that
there
is
more
to
his
mother
than
previous
thought
.
Although
fill
with
small
,
veri
funni
scene
,
Stuart
Save
His
Famili
also
has
it
share
of
dramat
moment
,
especi
toward
the
conclus
.
For
a
lightweight
comedi
,
it
handl
these
scene
especi
well
,
often
better
than
mani
so-cal
``
serious
drama
''
of
today
.
All
the
more
amaz
is
that
such
a
movi
come
from
a
Saturday
Night
Live
sketch
that
is
essenti
a
one-jok
bit
.
If
you
feel
like
rent
a
comedi
,
and
you
have
n't
seen
this
film
,
I
definit
recommend
you
tri
this
one
out
.
you
ll
laugh
...
you
ll
cri
...
.
it
's
all
there
.
