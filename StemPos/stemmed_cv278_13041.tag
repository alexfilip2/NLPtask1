Some
time
ago
,
a
young
director
was
given
the
opportun
to
direct
the
screen
version
of
a
popular
novel
.
The
novel
was
a
summer
smash
,
top
best-sel
list
across
the
countri
and
alreadi
draw
specul
as
to
which
popular
actor
of
the
day
might
play
the
lead
.
The
onli
problem
:
the
novel
was
n't
veri
good
.
It
was
far
more
pulp
than
Pulitz
.
But
the
director
realiz
that
,
no
matter
how
pedestrian
the
prose
,
this
book
realli
grab
people-that
the
author
,
while
not
a
great
writer
,
was
a
fantast
storytel
.
So
he
took
on
the
project
,
convinc
he
could
make
someth
happen
on
screen
.
The
director
?
Franci
Ford
Coppola
.
The
book
,
of
cours
,
was
Mario
Puzo
's
THE
GODFATHER
.
The
rest
,
as
they
say
in
showbiz
,
was
histori
.
By
bring
up
THE
GODFATHER
,
I
do
n't
mean
to
suggest
that
Robert
Altman
's
THE
GINGERBREAD
MAN
is
destin
for
that
level
of
great
.
But
the
parallel
doe
suggest
that
it
is
possibl
to
creat
great
cinema
from
question
sourc
materi
.
Can
you
get
ani
more
question
than
John
Grisham
?
Depend
on
whom
you
ask
.
But
there
's
no
question
that
Grisham
's
work
grab
peopl
.
Like
Puzo
,
Grisham
is
a
better
storytel
than
a
writer-unlik
fellow
hack
Michael
Crichton
,
who
is
a
good
idea
man
but
who
ca
n't
tell
a
well-construct
stori
from
a
can
of
Spam
.
So
someth
in
Grisham
's
unpublish
stori
of
a
cocki
Savannah
lawyer
who
get
involv
in
a
dead
famili
squabbl
drew
the
attent
of
Robert
Altman
,
who
atyear
old
remain
one
of
America
's
greatest
live
filmmak
.
The
result
is
a
grip
thriller
that
,
while
fall
short
of
classic
cinema
,
deserv
it
place
in
the
Altman
canon
.
>
From
it
open
shot
to
the
close
credit
,
THE
GINGERBREAD
MAN
is
permeat
with
a
sens
of
dread
,
with
a
fear
of
the
natur
destruct
forc
of
the
univers
.
This
terrif
sens
of
mood
is
a
classic
Altman
touch
.
Wit
said
open
shot
:
we
see
an
aerial
view
of
coastal
Georgia
with
it
writh
,
undul
landscap
while
the
soundtrack
grumbl
omin
in
our
ear
.
We
roll
over
the
hill
into
the
town
of
Savannah
,
then
zoom
in
close
on
a
red
sport
car
speed
over
a
bridg
while
it
driver
chatter
oblivi
on
his
cell
phone
.
Right
away
we
know
that
the
driver
of
that
car
is
in
for
a
few
surpris
.
Pay
attent
,
boy
and
girls-thi
shot
was
not
conceiv
by
John
Grisham
,
but
by
Altman
.
This
is
what
a
great
director
can
do
for
question
sourc
materi
.
The
sport
car
belong
to
Rick
Magrud
-LRB-
Kenneth
Branagh
-RRB-
,
the
aforement
hotshot
attorney
who
special
in
polic
brutal
case
.
Magrud
has
just
won
a
high
profil
case
and
celebr
that
night
with
a
cater
parti
at
his
offic
.
Outsid
after
the
parti
he
meet
one
of
the
waitress
,
Mallori
Doss
-LRB-
Embeth
Davidzt
-RRB-
,
just
as
she
realiz
her
car
has
been
stolen
.
Driven
by
Southern
chivalri
,
a
drive
rainstorm
and
his
unspoken
attract
to
the
fragil
waitress
,
Magrud
offer
her
a
ride
home
.
There
he
learn
more
about
Mallori
's
life
than
he
bargain
for
.
Her
car
was
stolen
by
her
schizophren
father
Dixon
-LRB-
Robert
Duval
-RRB-
,
a
Ted
Kyzynski-styl
whacko
who
has
been
stalk
and
terror
his
own
daughter
.
Magrud
,
perhap
influenc
by
Mallori
's
decis
to
strip
off
her
wet
cloth
in
front
of
him
,
is
sympathet
to
her
plight
,
and
offer
to
help
her
get
her
father
committed-right
after
he
sleep
with
her
,
of
cours
.
This
simpl
offer
of
help
lead
Magrud
down
a
danger
path
with
a
black
end
.
He
succeed
in
have
Dixon
incarcer
in
a
mental
hospit
,
and
for
a
moment
all
appear
well
.
But
then
Dixon
's
crack
team
of
homeless
commando
bust
him
out
of
the
lockup-and
sudden
Magrud
find
himself
,
Mallori
and
his
own
children
in
danger
.
The
cop
wo
n't
lift
a
finger
to
help
a
liber
attorney
.
His
onli
alli
are
his
faith
assist
Loi
-LRB-
Daryl
Hannah
-RRB-
and
his
bumbl
private-ey
sidekick
Clyde
-LRB-
Robert
Downey
Jr
-RRB-
.
If
this
predica
was
n't
bad
enough
,
Hurrican
Geraldo
is
bear
down
on
Savannah
and
throw
the
world
into
chao
.
Altman
may
provid
the
atmospher
,
but
Branagh
's
perform
hold
THE
GINGERBREAD
MAN
togeth
.
An
accomplish
actor
when
he
is
n't
direct
himself
in
vaniti
product
,
Branagh
doe
a
fine
job
of
make
Rick
a
sympathet
hero
while
cast
doubt
upon
his
motiv
.
Is
his
offer
of
help
to
Mallori
an
act
of
kind
,
or
of
egot
?
Magrud
is
so
sure
of
his
place
in
the
world
that
he
never
consid
that
he
has
bitten
off
more
than
he
can
chew
until
he
has
to
swallow
it-and
by
then
it
's
too
late
.
As
the
plot
unfold
,
Magrud
learn
that
none
of
us
are
as
secur
as
we
think
we
are
.
And
life
is
never
so
bad
that
it
ca
n't
get
wors
.
If
you
re
familiar
with
Altman
's
work
,
you
ll
recogn
sever
of
his
signatur
techniqu
.
Charact
are
not
introduc
in
establish
shot
,
but
rather
are
allow
to
wander
in
the
background
of
scene
until
their
import
becom
appar
.
Crucial
scene
are
shot
from
the
outsid
through
window
,
make
the
audienc
unwit
voyeur
of
the
action
.
Dialog
overlap
and
the
actor
seem
to
slip
natur
into
an
improvis
style
.
And
of
cours
there
's
my
favorit
Altman
technique-th
Obligatori
Nude
Actress
shot
.
Thank
to
Altman
,
here
are
some
of
the
actress
I
ve
had
the
pleasur
of
see
nake
:
Salli
Kellerman
,
Juliann
Moor
,
Madelin
Stow
,
even
Franc
McDormand
.
And
now
I
can
add
Embeth
Davidtz
,
who
look
quit
healthi
in
the
altogeth
.
The
nake
actress
shot
has
becom
as
ubiquit
to
the
Altman
film
as
the
director
cameo
was
to
the
Hitchcock
film
.
Is
it
old-school
sexism
,
or
a
clever
in-jok
?
you
be
the
judg
.
But
back
to
the
pictur
at
hand
.
In
the
hand
of
a
mere
mortal
,
THE
GINGERBREAD
MAN
would
have
been
a
routin
thriller
,
no
better
or
wors
than
the
countless
other
we
ve
all
endur
.
In
the
hand
of
a
master
like
Altman
,
it
becom
an
exercis
in
existenti
doom
,
in
it
own
way
far
more
success
than
Scorses
's
CAPE
FEAR
remak
,
which
tri
for
the
same
result
.
What
may
prevent
it
from
endur
with
Altman
's
greatest
work
is
a
weak
third
act-in
fact
,
there
realli
is
no
third
act
in
Grisham
's
stori
,
so
it
appear
that
Altman
had
to
throw
in
the
hurrican
just
to
jazz
thing
up
.
But
there
are
true
moment
of
rivet
suspens
,
and
great
perform
by
Branagh
,
Davidzt
and
Downey
Jr-more
than
enough
to
see
you
through
.
That
Polygram
so
hate
this
pictur
that
they
tri
to
steal
final
cut
from
Altman
,
and
then
buri
the
market
campaign
when
he
won
it
back
,
should
tell
you
how
utter
clueless
of
qualiti
most
studio
are
.
They
probabl
want
it
to
look
more
like
A
TIME
TO
KILL
.
And
that
,
my
friend
,
should
make
you
veri
afraid
.
