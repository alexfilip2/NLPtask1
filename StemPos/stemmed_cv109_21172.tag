Oliver

David

has
a

mainstream
director
been
this
will
to
repeat
tipto
the
fine
line
between
point
social
commentari
and
outright
social
irrespons
.
While
Fincher

film
have
never

from
a
lack
of

's
The
Game

into
someth
like
a
definit
statement
.
Jack

Norton
,
act
as
both
narrat
and
protagonist
-RRB-
is
your
typic
cubicl
clone
,
whose
disillusion
is
amplifi
by
a
seem
incur
insomnia
.
On
the
offhand
advic
of
a
doctor
,
he
sit
in
on
group-therapi
session
for
everyth
from
blood
parasit
to
testicular
cancer
.
Here
he
meet
Bob
-LRB-
Marvin
Lee
Aday
,
AKA
Meat
Loaf
-RRB-
,
a
cancer-emascul
eunuch
with
profound
gynecomastia
.
Strang
,
the
releas
he
find
while
sob
on
Bob
's
breast
allow
him
to
sleep
at
night
,
at
least
until
a
fellow

come
along
to
ruin
thing
for
him
,
forc
a
grudg
compromis
that
recal
Monti
Python
in
it
dark
hilar
.
Later
,
he
meet
Tyler
Durden
-LRB-
Pitt
-RRB-
,
a
soap
salesman
with
a
decid
subvers
outlook
on
life
.
One
night
,
after
his
IKEA-furnish
condo
explod
-LRB-
do
n't
ask
--
you
ll
just
have
to
see
the
movi
,
awright
?
-RRB-
,
he
is
goad
by
Tyler
into
a
fight
,
and
damn
if
it
doe
n't
feel
good
.
It
is
pure
,
raw
exist
,
a
brief
moment
of
clariti
and
purpos
that
make
his
dreari
workaday
life
pale
in
comparison
.
He
move
into
Tyler
's
squalid
abandon
mansion
,
and
they
form
the
titular
organ
,
an
underground
therapi
group
where
men
bond
with
bare-knuckl
savageri
and
veri
few
rule
,
the
first
two
of
which
are
``
Do
n't
Talk
About
Fight
Club
.
''
Armed
with
charisma
and
an
attract
anti-corpor
philosophi
,
Tyler
assum
leadership
of
the
burgeon
membership
of
white-collar
slave
and
dead-end
McEmploye
.
Resent
creep
into
Jack
's
heart
,
made
wors
by
the
fact
that
Tyler
is
also
regular
and
noisili
bof
the
hate
Marla
.
Fund
by
a
frivol
lawsuit
,
Tyler
begin
mold
his
devote
into
an
armi
dedic
to
mischief
and
mayhem
.
Their
initi
juvenil
prank
-LRB-
like
piss
in
food
and
put
spike
belt
on
road
-RRB-
quick
evolv
into
someth
more
like
sedit
,
and
Jack
fear
that
thing
have
gone
sour
.
It
is
after
this
point
,
when
you
are
plenti
uncomfort
and
wonder
just
how
far
Fincher
will
go
to
say
someth
origin
,
that
the
film
uncork
a
disappoint
plot
twist
.
It
is
so
contriv
--
and
so
convent
compar
to
what
preced
it
--
that
everyth
which
follow
-LRB-
includ
the
end
-RRB-
becom
far
less
interest
.
It
's
a
major
-LRB-
though
not
fatal
-RRB-
flaw
,
and
for
a
director
as
notori
unpredict
as
Fincher
,
it
feel
like
a
cop-out
.
Fight
Club
is
go
to
be
misconstru
by
a
great
mani
peopl
.
In
the
earli
go
,
it
has
a
downright
danger
feel
;
it
seem
to
be
say
that
violenc
and
civil
disobedi
are
good
for
the
soul
,
and
this
is
undoubt
the
messag
that
a
few
moron
punk
are
go
to
take
from
it
.
I
ll
be
mightili
surpris
if
imit
Fight
Club
do
n't
spring
up
here
and
there
,
and
I
ll
be
even
more
amaz
if
Fincher
is
n't
vilifi
for
it
by
the
same
humorless
witch-hunt
that
are
current
after
Oliver
Stone
.
They
bother
,
becaus
Fight
Club
is
less
a
messag
movi
than
Fincher
's
elabor
attempt
at
a
joke
.
Tyler
Durden
,
for
all
his
Dionysian
allur
,
is
realli
noth
more
than
the
logic
-LRB-
and
far
less
hypocrit
-RRB-
extrapol
of
all
those
self-help
gurus
who
constant
show
up
on
Oprah
to
preach
their
me-first
gospel
of
self-actu
.
In
this
context
,
the
joke
work
,
but
like
the
latest
Columbin
joke
,
some
peopl
will
get
it
and
enjoy
a
good
laugh
,
and
other
wo
n't
.
Hope
,
though
,
their
silli
moral
outrag
wo
n't
spoil
the
joke
for
the
rest
of
us
.
