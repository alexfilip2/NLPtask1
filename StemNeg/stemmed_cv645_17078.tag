Jawbreak
is
the
veri
definit
of
a
``
rip-off
.
''
This
uninspir
teen
comedi
take
equal
part
Carri
-LRB-
1976
-RRB-
,
Heather
-LRB-
1989
-RRB-
and
Clueless
-LRB-
1995
-RRB-
and
mix
in
all
the
necessari
teen
movi
clich
.
Along
the
way
writer/director
Darren
Stein
forget
to
give
the
film
a
life
of
it
own
.
The
film
open
with
a
voic
over
from
geeki
Fern
Mayo
-LRB-
Judi
Greer
-RRB-
about
the
four
most
popular
girl
at
Reagan
High
:
Courtney
Shayn
-LRB-
Rose
McGowan
-RRB-
who
can
basic
be
sum
up
as
Satan
in
heel
,
Juli
Freeman
-LRB-
Rebecca
Gayheart
-RRB-
a
good
girl
with
the
face
of
a
supermodel
,
Marci
Fox
-LRB-
Juli
Benz
-RRB-
a
dim-wit
blond
who
demand
that
peopl
call
her
``
Foxi
''
,
and
Liz
Purr
-LRB-
Charlott
Roldan
-RRB-
an
angel
in
disguis
.
Liz
is
everyon
's
favorit
becaus
she
's
both
beauti
and
kind
.
Liz
is
about
to
turn
17
and
,
as
a
prank
,
Courtney
convinc
the
other
girl
to
help
her
in
kidnap
Liz
on
her
birthday
morn
.
In
order
to
keep
Liz
from
make
ani
nois
Courtney
stuff
a
jawbreak
into
her
mouth
befor
they
gag
her
.
They
then
stuff
Liz
in
the
trunk
of
Courtney
's
car
but
when
they
open
it
later
,
Polaroid
camera
wait
to
captur
the
moment
,
their
live
will
never
be
the
same
:
poor
Liz
has
swallow
the
jawbreak
and
choke
to
death
with
it
lodg
in
her
throat
-LRB-
the
audienc
is
treat
to
a
few
too
mani
graphic
look
at
Liz
's
dead
bodi
-RRB-
.
Courtney
,
think
fast
,
decid
to
pass
the
death
off
as
a
rape/murd
and
Marci
and
a
reluct
Juli
assist
her
.
Thing
get
complic
when
Fern
discov
what
the
three
girl
are
up
to
.
In
order
to
keep
her
quiet
Courtney
come
up
with
anoth
plan
and
transform
geeki
Fern
into
``
Vylett
''
,
hope
that
she
will
also
help
to
replac
Liz
in
the
mind
of
the
devast
student
.
Up
until
about
this
point
the
film
is
effect
enough
.
Howev
,
an
investig
begin
into
Liz
's
death
and
the
film
becom
excess
dull
.
The
recent
rediscov
talent
of
Pam
Grier
are
thorough
wast
in
the
role
of
Detect
Vera
Cruz
and
the
film
is
downright
insipid
in
it
treatment
of
both
the
charact
and
the
audienc
dure
this
long
middl
stretch
.
Courtney
's
plan
to
frame
a
sleazi
guy
-LRB-
Marilyn
Manson
,
in
a
brief
cameo
-RRB-
is
never
believ
for
a
second
.
Meanwhil
,
the
audienc
is
stuck
watch
a
string
of
random
event
which
fail
to
develop
the
charact
or
add
anyth
of
interest
to
the
plot
.
Juli
leav
the
group
and
begin
a
lame
romanc
with
aspir
actor
Zack
-LRB-
Chad
Christ
-RRB-
.
He
appar
give
her
the
courag
to
turn
on
Courtney
but
the
way
thing
develop
onli
make
Juli
look
stupid
.
Fern
's
rise
to
popular
is
equal
lame
.
We
do
get
the
best
scene
in
the
film
-LRB-
the
onli
one
with
a
spark
of
origin
-RRB-
dure
this
section
.
It
's
a
smart
and
subvers
bit
where
Courtney
get
the
high
school
's
resid
jock
stud
Dane
-LRB-
Ethan
Erickson
-RRB-
to
demonstr
,
use
a
popsicl
,
exact
what
he
would
like
for
her
to
do
to
him
.
It
at
least
provid
us
with
a
look
at
Courtney
's
person
but
the
way
the
scene
finish
doe
n't
make
ani
sens
.
Stein
is
veri
conscious
of
the
teen
movi
tradit
he
is
work
in
and
not
onli
freeli
borrow
major
plot
element
but
also
includ
direct
acknowledg
of
this
with
some
stunt
cast
.
William
Katt
and
P.J.

-LRB-
student
in
Carri

are
Liz
's
distraught
parent
,
Jeff

camp
it
up
as
princip
Miss
Sherman
.
At
time
Jawbreak
feel
simpli
like
Teen
Cinema
's
Greatest
Hit
but
the
audienc
is
cheat
with
water
down
interpret
of
the
best
this
genr
has
to
offer
.
The
onli
notabl
aspect
of
Jawbreak
is
the
incred
stylish
look
.
The
costum
design
by
Vicki
Brinkford
and
the
product
design
by
Jerri
Fleme
are
both
bright
and
vivid
.
They
were
appar
instruct
to
work
from
the
color
palett
of
a
jawbreak
and
the
screen
is
alway
splash
with
bit
of
vibrant
color
.
Director

Ami
Vicent
,
who
beauti

Eve
's
Bayou
-LRB-
1997
-RRB-
,
doe
a
remark
job
here
as
well
.
Shot
composit
and
camera
movement
is
consist
impress
.
Perform
are
most
sub-par
with
McGowan
provid
onli
a
few
good
moment
-LRB-
compar
with
her
excel
work
in
The
Doom
Gener
-LRB-
1995
-RRB-
and
Scream
-LRB-
1996
-RRB-
-RRB-
and
Gayheart
make
the
biggest
impress
due
to
the
sweet
natur
of
her
charact
and
her
obvious
beauti
.
None
of
the
actor
look
as
if
they
have
set
foot
insid
a
high
school
within
the
last
five
year
with
the
except
of
actress/sing
Tatyana
Ali
,
who
has
a
small
role
as
a
cheerlead
.
The
male
cast
all
resembl
male
model
and
are
credit
with
name
like
``
Auto
Stud
,
''
``
Colleg
Stud
,
''
and
``
High
School
Stud
#
2
.
''
The
soundtrack
is
decent
and
Imperial
Teen
's
catchi
``
yoo
Hoo
''
make
a
bigger
impress
than
ani
other
aspect
of
the
film
.
