the
Drive
Me
Crazi
's
releas
by
the
dozen
these
last
coupl
of
year

What
I
realli
look
for
in
this
kind
of
movi
is
the
entertain
valu
while
I
'm
sit
in
the
theater
.
Am
I
enjoy
myself
?
Is
this
a
comfort
break
from
my
week
of
final

This
is

I
have

Sinc

director
Robert
Iscove
and
actor
Freddi
Prinz
Jr.
,
I
predict
dj
vu
al
over
again
.
But
,
still
curious
,
I
ask
around
my
school
and
from
the
one
or
two
peopl
who
had
seen
it
,
the
reaction
were
far
from
posit
.
I
had
made
up
my
mind
;
I
ll
catch
it
on
video
or
cabl
in
a
coupl
of
year
.
But
,
soon
after
,
follow
a
seri
of
unexpect
event
-LRB-
we
could
n't
get
into
Shaft
becaus
it
is
rate
R
-RRB-
,
I
found
myself
watch
Boy
and
Girl
.
Whoop
.
Boy
and
Girl
is
about
a
``
nerdi
,
smart
''
boy
name
Ryan
-LRB-
Prinz
Jr.
-RRB-
and
a
``
popular
,
flirt
''
girl
name
Jennif
-LRB-
Clair
Forlani
-RRB-
.
Briefli
meet
as
pre-teen
and
now
attend
the
same
colleg
,
the
two
bump
into
each
other
so
mani
time
that
eventu
they
becom
best
friend
.
But
in
the
movi
,
a
male
and
a
femal
can
not
be
friend
without
have
that
nag
feel
of
attract
for
each
other
.
With
advic
from
their
roommat
-LRB-
Amanda
Detmer
,
Jason
Bigg
-RRB-
,
Ryan
and
Jennif
attempt
to
discov
the
true
mean
of
their
relationship
.
The
film
definit
live
up
to
the
dread
three
adjectives-and
mindless
entertain
is
nowher
to
be
found
.
I
could
hard
sit
through
theminut
run
time
for
sever
reason
.
The
dialogu
is
probabl
the
worst
I
have
ever
seen
in
ani
movi
,
main
becaus
the
whole
movi
depend
on
the
bore
script
and
the
ridicul
word
these
charact
use
is
what
Hollywood
think
kid
can
relat
to
.
It
is
almost
offens
.
An
exampl
of
an
insight
convers
:
-LRB-
Well
it
's
not
as
bad
as
Wing
Command
I
guess
-RRB-
The
support
cast
is
also
pain
useless
.
Detmer
and
Bigg
stand
in
the
way
for
anyth
interest
to
happen
with
their
own
bore
,
pointless
subplot
.
And
although
this
is
suppos
to
be
from
both
perspect
of
the
human
sex
,
Prinz
Jr
's
Ryan
domin
the
screen
while
Forlani
's
Jennif
simpli
act
as
a
dilemma
for
him
to
work
with
.
We
never
learn
anyth
about
Jennif
which
is
a
shame
too
becaus
Forlani
is
the
onli
actor
to
bring
ani
life
into
her
charact
.
Teenag
or
not
:
you
ll
hate
this
movi
,
I
guarante
it
.
Mayb
I
should
rent
She
's
All
That
again
.
Is
it
realli
as
good
as
I
think
it
is
?
