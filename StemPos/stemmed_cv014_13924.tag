The
polic
negoti
is
the
person
with
the
entir
unenvi
job
of
go
into
ground
zero
and
attempt
to
talk
a
danger
crimin
out
of
do
whatev
he
or
she
intend
to
do
.
Live
are
often
at
stake
,
and
the
crimin
is
usual
arm
and
most
like
mental
unstabl
,
prone
to
turn
on
the
negoti
at
a
moment
's
notic
.
The
negoti
must
therefor
be
someth
of
an
actor
,
psychologist
,
and
sham
artist
,
in
addit
to
be
a
polic
offic
;
he
must
be
abl
to
think
on
his
feet
and
either
work
toward
the
goal
of
end
the
confront
without
violenc
,
or
fail
that
,
must
be
prepar
to
facilit
the
conclus
of
the
crisi
through
firepow
.
Most
of
all
,
the
negoti
must
be
abl
to
enter
a
situat
with
as
littl
intellig
about
the
scenario
as
possibl
,
and
quick
gain
control
of
the
situat
,
domin
the
convers
,
and
influenc
the
perpetr
into
think
that
the
end
of
the
conflict
is
what
he
realli
want
.
It
take
a
pretti
smart
person
to
do
that
.
But
what
if
the
hostage-hold
crimin
is
just
as
smart
?
What
if
he
's
also
abl
to
think
on
his
feet
?
In
fact
,
what
if
he
also
know
all
the
trick
to
turn
the
situat
to
his
favor
?
It
is
this
circumst
which
form
the
basi
for
F.
Gari
Gray
's
THE
NEGOTIATOR
.
In
this
film
,
polic
negoti
Danni
Roman
-LRB-
Samuel
L.
Jackson
-RRB-
is
tip
off
by
his
partner
to
corrupt
within
the
Chicago
polic
forc
.
When
his
partner
turn
up
shot
to
death
and
Internal
Affair
find
incrimin
evid
in
Roman
's
home
,
Roman
becom
the
prime
suspect
of
both
embezzl
from
the
polic
disabl
fund
and
murder
.
Face
with
the
scorn
of
most
of
the
polic
depart
,
and
under
close
scrutini
by
the
media
,
Roman
is
forc
to
turn
in
his
badg
in
one
of
those
typic
scene
in
the
captain
's
offic
.
I
do
n't
quit
rememb
if
the
captain
actual
said
,
``
I
hate
to
do
this
,
but
...
''
,
although
it
would
n't
surpris
me
if
he
did
.
Luckili
,
the
film
soon
shake
off
the
convent
and
concentr
on
the
interest
premis
mention
abov
.
After
be
offer
a
take-it-or-leave-it
deal
by
the
District
Attorney
,
Roman
resolv
to
prove
his
innoc
by
walk
into
the
offic
of
Internal
Affair
Inspector
Niebaum
-LRB-
J.T.
Walsh
-RRB-
,
take
him
and
other
hostag
,
and
proclaim
he
has
been
frame
.
Although
Roman
's
action
seem
forc
due
to
the
compress
natur
of
his
motiv
build-up
,
Gray
redeem
himself
by
involv
us
with
the
negoti
between
Roman
and
fellow
polic
negoti
Chris
Sabian
-LRB-
Kevin
Spacey
-RRB-
which
soon
ensu
.
Jackson
,
while
a
superb
actor
,
is
miscast
in
the
role
of
Roman
.
The
actor
has
becom
so
popular
,
and
so
often
identifi
as
a
protagonist
-LRB-
notabl
except
can
be
found
,
such
as
in
JACKIE
BROWN
-RRB-
,
that
we
as
an
audienc
have
a
difficult
time
believ
he
will
carri
out
his
threat
.
The
script
also
clear
set
him
up
as
the
good
guy
who
is
onli
tri
to
prove
his
innoc
.
How
can
we
believ
he
's
go
to
shoot
a
hostag
,
no
matter
if
the
hostag
tri
to
kill
him
earlier
?
Unfortun
,
this
preconcept
sap
the
film
of
some
of
it
's
would-b
suspens
moment
,
and
anyth
good
left
in
those
scene
is
larg
attribut
to
Jackson
's
act
abil
.
Almost
everi
time
he
's
in
a
scene
,
Jackson
steal
it
without
look
back
.
When
Spacey
appear
,
the
film
has
alreadi
run
about
a
third
of
it
cours
.
His
is
an
interest
charact
.
Made
out
to
be
some
kind
of
negoti
superman
,
our
first
look
at
him
has
him
hopeless
tri
to
get
his
famili
move
to
set
out
on
vacat
.
``
I
can
talk
a
man
out
of
blow
up
the
Sear
Tower
,
but
I
ca
n't
talk
my
wife
out
of
the
bedroom
or
my
daughter
off
the
phone
,
''
he
say
.
When
he
get
the
call
to
action
,
howev
,
he
quick
chang
gear
and
becom
the
man
we
expect
him
to
be
.
Soon
,
his
charact
has
to
negoti
not
onli
with
Roman
,
but
also
with
the
SWAT
command
-LRB-
David
Mors
-RRB-
who
is
itch
to
send
in
a
team
to
take
Roman
out
,
all
the
while
keep
wari
of
the
FBI
agent
who
are
wait
to
take
over
the
oper
,
should
negoti
fail
.
This
complex
set
of
pressur
are
reflect
well
in
Sabian
the
negoti
and
Spacey
the
actor
.
As
the
second
protagonist
,
Spacey
measur
up
nice
.
Gray
realli
luck
out
with
this
cast
.
David
Mors
as
Command
Beck
,
Ron
Rifkin
as
Command
Frost
,
and
John
Spencer
as
Polic
Chief
Al
Travi
are
all
more
than
compet
,
and
can
hold
their
own
in
scene
with
Jackson
and
Spacey
.
The
onli
problem
is
the
bit
of
typecast
that
result
from
these
choic
:
Mors
play
a
similar
role
in
THE
ROCK
,
Rifkin
play
the
D.A.
in
L.A.
CONFIDENTIAL
,
and
Spencer
play
a
polic
detect
in
COP
LAND
.
With
the
level
of
act
,
howev
,
this
can
be
forgiven
.
Also
in
the
support
cast
,
Paul
Giamatti
as
Rudi
,
one
of
the
hostag
,
is
notabl
for
the
comic
relief
he
provid
.
His
charact
is
initi
so
slimi
,
and
Giamatti
himself
just
look
so
shifti
,
that
you
expect
to
laugh
befor
he
even
say
anyth
.
Fortun
,
this
doe
n't
distract
from
the
serious
of
the
rest
of
the
film
,
but
instead
provid
some
nice
breather
from
the
level
of
tension
which
Gray
manag
to
sustain
throughout
.
J.T.
Walsh
,
as
the
suspici
Internal
Affair
inspector
,
clock
in
with
one
of
his
final
perform
.
Sad
,
the
talent
but
underr
actor
pass
away
in
late
Februari
of
this
year
,
and
the
soon
to
be
releas
PLEASANTVILLE
will
mark
his
last
film
.
Walsh
appear
in
dozen
of
movi
such
as
GOOD
MORNING
VIETNAM
,
BACKDRAFT
,
and
NIXON
.
For
one
of
his
best
perform
,
check
out
SLING
BLADE
,
in
which
he
play
a
mental
patient
share
a
ward
with
Billi
Bob
Thornton
.
When
Jack
Nicholson
accept
his
best
actor
Oscar
in
March
,
Walsh
was
one
of
the
men
to
whom
he
credit
his
success
-LRB-
the
actor
perform
togeth
in
A
FEW
GOOD
MEN
-RRB-
.
THE
NEGOTIATOR
is
actual
dedic
to
Walsh
,
and
while
Inspector
Niebaum
may
not
have
been
his
best
role
,
it
certain
character
the
type
of
charact
for
which
Walsh
had
becom
most
famous
for
play
.
In
the
end
,
THE
NEGOTIATOR
has
a
plotlin
that
parallel
it
's
realiti
.
We
re
serv
with
the
premis
that
two
equal
deft
negoti
are
battl
each
other
to
resolv
the
conflict
in
the
manner
which
will
suit
each
of
them
best
.
As
an
audienc
,
we
re
also
given
a
situat
where
two
wonder
talent
actor
are
thrown
into
a
movi
,
and
we
'd
like
to
see
if
one
will
domin
the
film
.
Both
provid
some
pretti
good
entertain
.
