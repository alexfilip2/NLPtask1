``

Gellar
's
Amanda
find
herself
fall
for
harri
Henri
Bendel
exec
Tom
-LRB-
Sean
Patrick
Flanneri
of
Powder
-RRB-
around
the
same
time
she
discov
an
uncanni
abil
to
mystic
manifest
emot
in
her
cook
,
a
secret
ingredi
that
arous
both
his
interest
in
her
and
the
public
's
in
her
tini
TriBeCa
eateri
.
All
this
love
and
sorceri
have
a
lot
to
do
with
the
telekinet
crab
that
also
figur
into
the
stori
,
a
tale
that
at
time
play
like
an
American
spin
on
1993
's
Mexican
classic
``
Like
Water
for
Chocol
.
''
Sever
differ
:
One
,
``
Like
Water
''
did
n't
have
a
telekinet
crab
,
and
two
,
``
Like
Water
''
was
a
good
film
.
``
Simpli
Irresist
,
''
on
the
other
hand
,
is
about
as
challeng
as
an
Easy-Bak
Oven
.
Amateurish
stage
scene
cancel
each
other
out
in
their
bad
,
from
an
embarrass
seduct
in
a
liter
vanilla
fog
to
an
impromptu
danc
sequenc
where
Tom
and
Amanda
do
their
best
Fred
and
Ginger-though
Fred
and
Ginger
never
took
part
in
anyth
this
garish
.
The
intrus
music
score
distract
from
the
flat
dialogu
at
regular
interv
,
but
it
's
not
like
you
re
were
go
to
miss
much
.
In
fact
,
take
away
the
few
instanc
of
salti
languag
and
this
has
made-for-Disney
Channel
written
all
over
it
.
But
a
major
of
``
Simpli
Irresist
''
's
resist
factor
has
less
to
do
with
the
afore-ment
overkil
than
the
bland
leads-Tom
and
Amanda
are
so
thin
and
ambigu
defin
that
there
's
just
no
fun
root
for
their
inevit
``
happili
ever
after
.
''
Nor
do
the
otherworld
power
that
serv
to
bring
them
togeth
make
sens
,
so
we
re
left
with
a
ho-hum
relationship
base
on
enchant
eclair
;
it
's
not
go
to
last
long
,
peopl
.
Perhap
sens
this
,
the
filmmak
have
pile
on
weird
support
charact
for
act
vet
like
Betti
Buckley
,
Dylan
Baker
and
Patricia
Clarkson
,
but
they
do
n't
go
anywher
either
.
In
fact
,
noth
in
``
Simpli
Irresist
''
goe
anywher
save
for
Gellar
,
and
she
doe
n't
go
somewher
so
much
as
you
wish
she
'd
go
_
somewher
_
-
like
to
a
better
movi
.
Alreadi
prove
major
talent
with
relat
few
big-and
small-screen
role
,
she
's
the
sole
reason
this
overcook
souffl
is
n't
complet
fit
for
the
garbag
dispos
,
look
smash
in
her
Todd
Oldham-design
dud
and
invest
much
more
in
her
perfunctori
part
than
she
ever
get
in
return
.
It
's
certain
a
dish
best
not
serv
in
it
's
current
condit
,
but
one
can
onli
guess
that
,
without
Gellar
,
``
Simpli
Irresist
''
would
be
strict
unwatch
.
