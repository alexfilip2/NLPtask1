Ever
wonder
what
happen
to
Gabe
Kaplan
?
you
rememb
,
he
was
the
titl
charact
in
that
70
's
sitcom
,
``
Welcom
Back
Kotter
.
''
Alway
tri
to
help
out
the
Sweathog
,
frequent
tri
to
dodg
Mr.
Woodman
,
ever
wari
of
his
wife
's
tuna
casserol
.
``
So
,
''
you
ask
,
``
where
is
he
now
?
''
Mr.
Kaplan
actual
spend
much
of
his
time
these
day
play
profession
high-stak
poker
.
That
's
right
.
I
'm
not
sure
if
it
's
his
main
sourc
of
incom
,
but
from
what
I
ve
heard
,
the
guy
occasion
come
away
with
$
20,000
at
a
time
.
And
there
you
were
,
think
I
was
go
to
tell
you
he
was
do
off-Broadway
theater
.
you
silli
goos
.
Well
,
Gabe
Kaplan
is
n't
in
the
movi
ROUNDERS
,
nor
is
the
film
about
the
actor
come
gambler
's
life
.
But
ROUNDERS
is
about
poker
,
and
Gabe
play
poker
,
and
I
thought
that
was
kind
of
a
neat
connect
.
Sorri
about
the
segu
,
or
lack
thereof
.
Matt
Damon
play
Mike
McDermott
,
a
law
student
who
also
has
a
singular
talent
for
the
game
of
poker
.
He
's
been
play
for
a
while
,
and
more
than
be
profici
,
he
has
caught
the
bug
.
He
goe
to
all
the
underground
game
in
New
york
Citi
,
know
the
regular
,
and
know
how
to
win
.
In
the
begin
of
the
film
,
he
's
built
up
a
nice
thirti
grand
nest
egg
,
which
he
take
to
the
speakeasy-typ
game
parlor
where
the
big
boy
play
.
Mike
is
there
to
make
his
bid
into
the
upper
echelon
by
stake
it
all
against
Teddi
KGB
-LRB-
John
Malkovich
-RRB-
,
an
Oreo-munch
cardshark
with
tie
to
the
Russian
Mafia
.
Mike
has
the
potenti
to
take
a
larg
pot
and
go
to
Vega
and
buy
into
the
World
Seri
of
Poker
,
but
instead
he
lose
it
all
in
a
singl
hand
.
Month
later
,
he
's
pay
his
way
through
law
school
by
drive
a
deliveri
truck
.
When
Mike
's
best
friend
and
poker
buddi
Worm
-LRB-
Edward
Norton
-RRB-
finish
his
jail
term
for
hustl
some
student
,
he
want
to
pick
up
right
were
they
left
off
,
work
as
a
team
to
part
other
with
their
bet
cash
.
Although
Mike
has
stop
play
card
as
a
promis
to
his
girlfriend
and
fellow
law
student
,
Jo
-LRB-
Gretchen
Mol
-RRB-
,
Worm
conniv
Mike
into
play
onc
more
,
and
Mike
,
bitten
again
by
the
bug
,
slide
down
that
slipperi
slope
,
risk
his
relationship
,
educ
,
and
reput
as
play
poker
again
becom
the
focus
of
his
life
.
To
make
a
film
about
gambl
,
a
filmmak
will
usual
have
to
play
up
the
glamor
side
to
get
the
audienc
behind
the
charact
.
This
is
becaus
few
moviego
will
care
a
whole
lot
about
some
guy
in
a
leisur
suit
or
terri
cloth
shirt
sit
at
a
fold
card
tabl
with
a
stogi
in
his
mouth
.
ROUNDERS
,
howev
,
seem
to
go
more
for
the
latter
than
the
former
.
The
card
club
Mike
and
Worm
frequent
are
n't
veri
glamor
at
all
.
There
's
a
basement
,
a
lodg
with
elk
head
on
the
wall
,
a
goulash
joint-thes
are
the
kind
of
local
in
which
director
John
Dahl
set
his
shot
.
Except
for
one
brief
instanc
when
the
two
player
visit
Atlantic
Citi
,
the
film
is
bereft
of
the
flash
light
of
the
casino
or
the
pleasant
color
of
the
green
felt
tabl
.
The
reason
ROUNDERS
still
captur
our
attent
is
becaus
it
is
less
about
the
game
of
poker
than
it
is
about
the
person
which
enjoy
and
are
slave
to
it
.
We
re
given
a
nice
set
of
interest
charact
with
clear
motiv
,
and
good
actor
to
play
them
.
Matt
Damon
is
veri
natur
as
Mike
,
who
struggl
between
his
desir
to
play
the
straight
and
narrow
by
finish
law
school
,
and
answer
what
may
be
his
true
call
,
play
profession
poker
.
Ed
Norton
's
Worm
is
truli
a
worm
,
alway
look
for
the
angl
and
play
everyon
for
what
they
re
worth
.
John
Turturro
,
who
amaz
me
with
his
act
rang
,
tone
it
down
in
this
film
by
play
Joey
Knish
,
a
virtual
poker
prodigi
in
his
time
who
now
play
the
underground
game
to
make
rent
and
child
support
payment
.
He
's
both
a
friend
and
mentor
to
Mike
,
and
Turturro
's
low-key
perform
is
total
convinc
,
just
as
John
Malkovich
's
heavily-acc
Teddi
KGB
is
impos
as
an
adversari
dragon
Mike
must
slay
to
prove
himself
.
Martin
Landau
is
also
thrown
into
the
mix
as
one
of
Mike
's
law
professor
,
Abe
Petrovski
.
While
Landau
slip
well
into
the
role
,
his
charact
,
spit
out
person
anecdot
about
stay
true
to
one
's
self
,
facilit
the
channel
of
the
storylin
toward
a
predict
end
.
Perhap
the
weak
link
in
the
otherwis
formid
line-up
of
act
talent
,
howev
,
is
Gretchen
Mol
who
just
did
n't
seem
to
have
much
presenc
on
screen
.
She
's
a
genuin
peach
to
look
at
,
kind
of
a
cross
between
actress
Rene
Zellweg
and
singer
Jewel
-LRB-
and
I
would
n't
be
surpris
if
the
three
of
them
form
some
kind
of
blond-hair
triumvir
and
attempt
to
take
over
the
world
-RRB-
,
but
her
deliv
line
seem
veri
flat
,
and
I
found
myself
look
for
Matt
Damon
's
reaction
instead
.
A
good
thing
about
ROUNDERS
is
that
it
doe
n't
get
bog
down
in
the
charact
develop
and
statement
make
so
much
that
it
ca
n't
find
time
for
humor
.
The
film
is
pepper
nice
with
scene
that
both
make
you
laugh
and
keep
the
pace
go
,
such
as
a
sequenc
where
Mike
and
Worm
move
rapid
around
New
york
from
one
game
to
the
next
,
in
wide
differ
local
.
One
game
in
a
cigar
club
had
me
in
stitch
.
``
I
LOVE
the
sweet
of
this
dark
maduro
wrapper
,
''
say
one
of
the
player
,
clear
more
interest
in
display
his
pretenti
over
the
cigar
in
one
hand
than
in
the
card
in
his
other
.
I
was
hope
Mike
and
Worm
would
realli
take
these
guy
.
With
all
the
poker
be
play
,
ROUNDERS
had
the
potenti
to
be
veri
confus
.
you
might
think
you
know
a
lot
about
poker
,
but
think
again
.
Luckili
,
we
re
given
a
narrat
by
Damon
dure
the
more
intric
moment
to
explain
what
's
go
on
.
The
narrat
are
more
inform
than
intrus
,
and
appris
us
of
what
the
stake
are
and
whi
certain
player
want
to
do
the
thing
they
do
.
It
's
nice
that
as
the
charact
develop
,
so
doe
our
comprehens
of
their
world
.
As
a
film
about
success
and
surviv
in
the
realm
of
underground
poker
,
ROUNDERS
deliv
in
spade
.
Wait
!
As
a
film
about
the
cultur
of
card
,
ROUNDERS
is
an
ace
.
Hang
on
!
Pack
with
great
act
and
great
charact
,
ROUNDERS
is
a
full
hous
.
Okay
,
I
guess
that
's
enough
.
Oh
,
by
the
way
,
if
you
ever
want
to
get
into
a
game
with
ol
'
Gabe
Kaplan
,
be
sure
to
bring
a
note
from
Epstein
's
mother
.
