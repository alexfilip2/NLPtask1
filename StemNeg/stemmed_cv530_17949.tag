These
day
the
lack
of
origin
in
Hollywood
reflect
itself
in
the
delug
of
remak
.
But
,
onli
a
few
year
ago
,
befor
Wes
Craven
public
made
fun
of
the
practic
,
sequel
had
been
more
popular
among
Hollywood
produc
.
Sequel
also
use
to
be
popular
among
director
and
movi
star
whose
career
went
south
.
The
way
to
regain
popular
and
prestig
,
they
thought
,
was
the
use
the
same
formula
,
charact
and
stori
line
that
brought
them
success
in
the
first
place
.
One
of
such
celebr
was
Eddie
Murphi
,
black
comedian
of
1980s
whose
career
was
in
big
declin
dure
the
first
part
of
this
decad
.
In
order
to
return
to
the
spotlight
,
he
chose
to
resurrect
the
franchis
creat
by
his
most
popular
film
,
BEVERLi
HILLS
COP
,
1984
action
comedi
that
had
alreadi
spawn
the
sequel
in
1987
.
Seven
year
later
,
for
the
third
instal
,
he
use
the
directori
servic
of
John
Landi
,
anoth
fade
star
,
with
whom
he
success
collabor
twice-in
TRADING
PLACES
and
COMING
TO
AMERICA
.
This
time
,
howev
,
third
time
was
n't
the
charm
and
BEVERLi
HILLS
III
was
failur
.
Eddie
Murphi
had
to
wait
few
more
year
for
real
comeback
.
Eddie
Murphi
here
play
Axel
Foley
,
fast-talk
streetwis
Detroit
policeman
,
who
raid
illeg
chop
shop
.
The
routin
polic
action
end
in
tragedi
,
when
the
crimin
kill
Foley
's
boss
.
Determin
to
bring
the
killer
to
justic
,
Foley
realis
that
their
leader
is
Ellis
De
Wald
-LRB-
Timothi
Carhart
-RRB-
.
When
it
turn
out
that
De
Wald
happen
to
be
secur
chief
for
Wonderland
theme
park
in
Los
Angele
,
Foley
goe
back
to
Los
Angele
.
There
,
with
the
help
of
his
old
friend
,
local
policeman
Rosewood
-LRB-
Judg
Rheinhold
-RRB-
,
Foley
would
clash
with
money
counterfeit
ring
.
Ten
year
has
pass
sinc
the
origin
and
time
are
definit
differ
.
In
this
decad
,
the
contrast
between
blue
collar
Detroit
and
yuppi
Bever
Hill
,
which
provid
a
lot
of
gag
in
1984
film
,
simpli
doe
n't
work
.
Screenwrit
Steven
E.
de
Souza
provid
anoth
conflict
,
this
time
between
the
childish
silly
of
the
Good
Guy
and
business-lik
profession
of
the
Bad
Guy
.
Sinc
Foley
belong
to
the
former
,
his
charact
had
to
watch
his
languag
,
and
the
tone
of
the
film
in
general
is
more
infantil
.
Unfortun
,
this
film
still
belong
to
action
movi
genr
,
and
there
is
too
much
violenc
for
littl
children
.
Nice
exampl
is
the
humor
scene
in
the
begin
,
which
turn
into
standard
Ramboesqu
bloodbath
.
Unlike
Donner
with
the
LETHAL
WEAPON
seri
,
Landi
simpli
ca
n't
balanc
the
comedi
with
``
regular
''
action
,
and
the
result
is
a
film
that
fail
in
both
aspect
.
Action
scene
are
sometim
interest
,
but
not
too
spectacular
-LRB-
at
the
end
,
sceneri
of
Wonderland
is
more
fascin
than
the
action
itself
-RRB-
;
humour
,
on
the
other
hand
,
fall
flat
.
To
make
even
wors
,
some
minor
charact
from
1984
film
get
unnecessari
and
sometim
irrit
overexposur
-LRB-
especi

.
In
the
end
,
although
the
film
provid
some
entertain
,
viewer
,
at
least
critic
one
,
would
probabl
be
happi
to
know
that
there
are
n't

for
BEVERLi
