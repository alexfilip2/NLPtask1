The
first
of
the
two
asteroid
movi
come
out
this
year
-LRB-
the
second
is
the
macho
Armageddon
-RRB-
is
actual
a
dull
affair
.
Elijah
Wood
play
Leo
Biederman
,
who
dure
Astronomi
class
discov
that
a
larg
asteroid
is
head
for
earth
.
Tea
Leoni
play
a
-LRB-
rather
crap
-RRB-
news
report
,
Jenni
Lerner
,
who
soon
discov
about
this
asteroid
through
a
veri
long
wind
and
bore
way
,
and
Robert
Duval
play
the
leader
of
a
space
crew
,
Spurgeon
Tanner
,
who
are
plan
to
blow
the
asteroid
out
of
the
path
of
Earth
.
Also
featur
is
Morgan
Freeman
as
the
Presid
,
and
Maximilian
Schell
and
Vanessa
Redgrav
as
Jenni
's
father
and
mother
.
While
mani
peopl
will
walk
into
the
film
expect
a
big
special
effect
fest
with
the
asteroid
blow
everyth
up
-LRB-
as
the
trailer
seem
to
promis
-RRB-
,
the
film
is
actual
more
of
a
charact
studi
,
if
a
veri
poor
one
.
The
main
problem
is
that
there
are
too
mani
charact
in
the
film
,
and
not
enough
time
to
explor
them
all
.
Onli
the
space
crew
are
given
ani
depth
,
Jenni
Lerner
,
Leo
and
the
presid
are
surpris
2D
,
and
we
never
get
to
know
these
charact
.
And
becaus
I
could
n't
care
for
them
,
I
did
n't
realli
give
a
crap
if
the
asteroid
kill
them
or
not
.
The
script
by
Bruce
Joel
Rubin
and
Michael
Tolkin
is
horribl
simpl
,
and
never
realli
make
ani
interest
statement
.
Mimi
Leder
,
the
former
ER
director
and
director
of
the
averag
The
Peacemak
-LRB-
1996
-RRB-
,
again
direct
in
a
ho-hum
style
,
and
never
realli
get
ani
emot
out
of
a
scene
,
which
is
a
shame
.
The
cast
are
seem
on
autopilot
,
although
Tea
Leoni
doe
give
a
rather
good
perform
,
even
if
she
act
a
bit
too
dorki
for
her
own
good
.
She
seem
uncommon
stupid
for
a
journalist
.
Robert
Duval
is
on
autopilot
with
a
underwritten
role
,
he
just
seem
to
be
in
this
film
for
the
money
.
Elijah
Wood
,
one
of
the
best
child
actor
work
today
,
is
surpris
averag
,
although
his
choic
of
role
late
have
n't
exact
been
brilliant
-LRB-
i.e.
Flipper
,
1996
-RRB-
.
His
role
is
also
vast
underwritten
.
Morgan
Freeman
,
again
,
is
utter
wast
with
a
ridicul
underwritten
role
.
Like
Duval
,
he
just
seem
to
be
in
the
film
for
the
money
.
The
support
cast
are
all
O.K
,
none
make
much
of
an
impress
.
OK
,
so
Deep
Impact
may
have
mess
up
charact
wise
,
but
sure
the
special
effect
are
good
?
Well
,
yes
and
no
.
Although
the
special
effect
should
be
impress
,
with
a
massiv
tidal
wave
destroy
New
york
,
the
special
effect
look
like
,
well
,
special
effect
.
Sad
,
the
wave
look
like
it
's
been
drawn
on
comput
,
and
doe
n't
look
too
good
at
all
.
Surpris
realli
,
when
the
effect
are
done
by
Industrial
Light
&
Magic
,
who
did
the
effect
for
The
Lost
World
and
Twister
.
In
the
end
,
Deep
Impact
is
a
wast
opportun
.
What
could
of
been
a
move
movi
with
good
effect
turn
out
to
be
a
dud
in
both
charact
and
effect
.
The
2
hour
the
film
had
could
have
been
use
to
much
greater
effect
.
Once
again
,
Dreamwork
has
churn
out
anoth
averag
movi
.
Let
's
hope
Armageddon
is
a
bit
better
.
