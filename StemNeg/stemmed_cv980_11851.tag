With
his
success
book
and
movi
,
Michael
Crichton
is
do
well
.
With
earli
success
with
Westworld
-LRB-
1973
-RRB-
and
Coma
-LRB-
1978
-RRB-
,
and
recent
film
such
as
Jurass
Park
-LRB-
1993
-RRB-
,
his
film
have
been
entertain
.
Howev
,
he
seem
to
taken
a
wrong
turn
somewher
with
Sphere
.
This
$
100
million
mess
by
good
director
Barri
Levison
-LRB-
Disclosur
-RRB-
is
dull
,
long
wind
,
and
a
huge
disappoint
.
Consid
the
huge
budget
,
the
all
star
cast
,
and
a
stori
by
Crichton
,
Sphere
is
major
disappoint
.
The
film
open
with
Norman
Goodman
-LRB-
Hoffman
-RRB-
,
a
psychologist
who
think
he
is
visit
an
airplan
crash
to
consol
the
survivor
.
Howev
,
when
he
arriv
,
he
his
told
by
supervisor
Barn
-LRB-
Peter
Coyot
-RRB-
that
he
is
actual
investig
an
spacecraft
.
Along
with
Goodman
is
mathematician
Harri
Adam
-LRB-
Jackson
-RRB-
,
biologist
Beth
Halperin
-LRB-
Stone
-RRB-
and
Ted
Field
-LRB-
Liev
Schrieber
.
-RRB-
They
investig
the
spaceship
,
find
a
massiv
sphere
insid
,
meet
an
alien
intellig
call
Jerri
,
and
basic
weird
crap
happen
.
Unfortun
,
someth
went
wrong
along
the
way
with
Sphere
.
The
film
start
off
entertain
enough
,
but
throughout
this
veri
long
movi
,
it
just
get
sillier
and
sillier
.
The
film
jaunt
along
from
scene
to
scene
,
never
fulli
explain
what
is
go
on
.
The
actor
and
direct
do
n't
help
,
either
.
Hoffman
is
on
autopilot
-LRB-
and
almost
seem
embarrass
-RRB-
throughout
the
movi
,
churn
out
dull
line
,
and
probabl
wonder
what
the
hell
he
is
do
in
this
movi
.
Stone
is
useless
,
display
no
emot
,
and
fail
to
convinc
the
audienc
that
she
has
ani
feel
for
Hoffman
.
The
onli
person
who
seem
to
be
have
fun
in
this
movi
is
Jackson
,
who
's
funni
as
the
mathematician
who
slowli
goe
crazi
and
enter
the
sphere
.
But
he
's
hard
in
it
,
and
by
the
end
of
the
film
he
is
just
as
dull
as
Hoffman
and
Stone
.
The
same
goe
for
Peter
Coyot
,
who
ham
it
up
as
the
offic
,
but
is
then
kill
off
halfway
through
.
The
director
,
Barri
Levinson
,
who
direct
the
better
Crichton
adapt
Disclosur
-LRB-
1994
-RRB-
mess
up
with
the
drama
and
the
action
.
The
drama
scene
are
,
quit
frank
,
bore
,
and
the
action
scene
suffer
from
overkil
,
with
Levison
throw
the
camera
all
over
the
place
-LRB-
much
like
the
godaw
Speed
2
,
1997
-RRB-
The
write
doe
n't
help
much
,
either
.
Although
Crichton
is
great
with
plot
,
he
's
terribl
with
dialogu
,
and
practic
everi
line
in
Sphere
is
a
dud
.
The
speech
is
too
simpl
,
I
was
hope
it
would
be
a
bit
more
intellig
.
Practic
everi
line
is
just
state
the
obvious
.
None
of
it
is
smart
.
Also
,
where
the
hell
did
the
budget
go
?
The
sphere
itself
is
impress
,
and
there
's
a
few
nice
special
effect
shot
,
but
where
the
$
100
million
went
is
anyon
's
guess
.
There
's
a
giant
squid
attack
in
the
pictur
,
but
not
onc
doe
the
audienc
see
the
squid
,
even
though
the
film
has
a
massiv
budget
.
I
assum
the
pictur
was
tri
to
build
up
tension
by
not
show
the
squid
,
and
if
handl
correct
it
probabl
would
.
But
the
whole
scene
is
done
bad
,
and
I
was
just
hope
we
could
see
the
stupid
squid
.
Final
,
the
film
has
no
idea
what
genr
to
be
.
Levison
ca
n't
handl
his
own
plot
.
It
leap
from
hokey
sci-fi
,
to
horror
,
and
final
The
Shining/Ev
Horizon
psycholog
thriller
.
And
,
of
cours
,
the
film
is
veri
much
like
The
Abyss
-LRB-
1988
-RRB-
,
although
in
it
's
defens
,
Crichton
did
write
Sphere
befor
The
Abyss
was
releas
-LRB-
and
is
far
superior
to
this
rubbish
.
-RRB-
It
's
not
all
that
bad
though
.
The
plot
is
all
right
,
there
's
a
few
jump
scene
-LRB-
although
noth
veri
scari
-RRB-
and
there
's
the
occasion
interest
bit
.
But
overal
,
Sphere
is
a
big
wast
of
some
fine
talent
,
a
lot
of
money
,
and
a
potenti
good
movi
.
Not
realli
worth
see
.
