in

a
comet
on

collis
cours
with

threaten
the
exist

all

on

It
is
the
latest
entri
in
this
decad
's
dubious
reviv
of
the
'
70s
disast
film
,
and
the
first
of

''
The
open
moment
of
Deep
Impact
offer
more
to
snicker
at
.
The
cheesi
is
not
confin
to
the
disast
movi
convent
,
such
as
the
usual
open
``
roll
call
,
''
in
which
all
the
major
charact
and
their
person
problem
are
introduc
.
The
most
promin
of
the
``
person
''
stori
is
that
of
ambiti
TV
news
report
Jenni
Lerner
-LRB-
Tea
Leoni
-RRB-
,
who
is
distraught
that
her
father
-LRB-
Maximilian

What
is
just
as
snicker-worthi
is
how
this
co-ventur
between
Paramount
and
DreamWork
SKG
aggress
push
anoth
high-profil
corpor
collabor
,
Microsoft
and
NBC
's
cabl
news
network
MSNBC
,
which
employ
Jenni
,
who
is
the
film
's
ostens
main
charact
.
In
the
vision
of
America
present
here
,
MSNBC
is
the
televis
news
sourc
of
choic
in
everi
home
,
when
in
realiti
it
onli
reach
a
fraction
of
the
countri
.
The
initi
sign
point
toward
someth
along
the
line
of
a
Volcano
or
Dant
's
Peak
,
but
there
's
one
thing
about
Deep
Impact
I
underestim
:
the
skill
of
director
Mimi
Leder
.
She
won
an
Emmi
for
her
helm
work
on
NBC
's
smash
ER
,
which
is
essenti
a
week
disast
movi
,
each
episod
featur
a
new
set
of
guest
star
with
their
own
person
and
medic
crise
.
The
challeng
present
by
this
format
to
the
director
is
twofold
:
-LRB-
1
-RRB-
to
make
the
audienc
care
for
these
guest
charact
,
regardless
of
how
briefli
seen
or
thin
written
they
are
,
and
-LRB-
2
-RRB-
power
tug
at
the
emot
without
be
heavy-hand
or
over
melodramat
.
Have
pass
the
``
ER
challeng
''
in
numer
episod
and
show
a
flair
for
creat
suspens
in
The
Peacemak
,
Leder
could
not
be
a
better
fit
to
bring
Michael
Tolkin
and
Bruce
Joel
Rubin
's
rather
formula
disast
screenplay
to
screen
.
As
the
countdown
to
impact
progress
,
the
omin
feel
of
doom
is
palpabl
,
lead
the
final
act
to
take
on
a
surpris
convinc
and
affect
emot
dimens
.
There
's
noth
here
that
will
profound
move
anyon
,
but
the
fact
that
anyth
manag
to
touch
the
heart
is
high
achiev
in
a
genr
general
more
concern
with
effect
.
Situat
that
initi
feel
contriv
,
such
as
Jenni
's
famili
crisi
and
the
teenag
romanc
between
Sarah
Hotchner
-LRB-
Leele
Sobieski
-RRB-
and
comet
discover
Leo
Biederman
-LRB-
Elijah
Wood
-RRB-
,
achiev
some
poignanc
;
and
even
the
more
vagu
drawn
charact
,
includ
U.S.
Presid
Tom
Beck
-LRB-
Morgan
Freeman
-RRB-
,
astronaut
Spurgeon
``
Fish
''
Tanner
-LRB-
Robert
Duval
-RRB-
,
and
his
rather
faceless
crew
-LRB-
Ron
Eldard
,
Jon
Favreau
,
Mari
McCormack
,
Blair
Underwood
,
and
Alexand
Baluyev
-RRB-
aboard
the
comet-bomb
spacecraft
Messiah
,
have
their
share
of
touch
moment
.
The
latter
fact
owe
a
debt
to
the
actor
,
who
all
do
a
solid
job
and
are
well-cast
,
with
the
possibl
except
of
Leoni
;
she
deliv
a
decent
perform
,
but
her
trademark
unconvent
speech
rhythm
and
line
deliveri
make
her
somewhat
hard
to
buy
as
a
star
news
broadcast
.
Although
it
catastroph
theme
and
impress
special
effect
work
-LRB-
the
giant
ocean
wave
are
particular
spectacular
-RRB-
place
Deep
Impact
in
the
same
categori
as
the
like
of
Twister
,
it
is
the
first
of
the
'
90s
disast
film
to
success
marri
the
advanc
film
technolog
with
emot
that
ring
true
--
a
film
that
make
a
genuin
impact
,
even
if
it
is
n't
as
deep
as
hope
.
