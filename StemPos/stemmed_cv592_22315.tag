Follow
this
sideshow
of
horror-lab
special
effect
we
are
plung
quick
into
a
non-stop
explor
of
the
weird
that
is
Leuchter
's
life
and
mind
.
Morri
follow
the
trail
of
Leuchter
's
mad
with
appal
lucid
,
reveal
in
a
surpris
and
frighten
way
what
most
of
us
could
have
guess
to
begin
with
:
This
Leuchter
guy
is
serious
mess
up
.
Virtual
rais
within
the
American
penal
system
by
a
father
who
work
within
prison
wall
,
Leuchter
seem
to
have
come
somewhat
natur
into
his
profess
;
design
and
maintain
execut
equip
for
state
penitentiari
,
in
spite
of
his
lack
of
credenti
.
After
a
moder
success
career
make
electr
chair
and
design
gas
chamber
and
gallow
,
Leuchter
came
to
the
attent
of
neo-Nazi
and
revisionist
historian
Ernst
Zundel
,
who
was
face
crimin
charg
in
Germani
for
publish
his
`
theori
'
that
the
holocaust
never
happen
.
Morri
's
interview
are
surpris
congeni
,
draw
the
subject
into
a
carefre
banter
that
give
them
more
than
enough
rope
with
which
to
hang
themselv
.
Zundel
speak
to
the
camera
as
though
it
were
his
mensch
.
Leuchter
seem
complet
at
eas
,
sometim
jovial
.
Part
of
this
effect
may
be
due
to
Morri
's
new
interview
machin
,
call
the
Interrotron
,
which
is
respons
for
creat
eye
contact
between
the
subject
and
the
interview
.
This
was
the
first
time
Morri
had
use
the
devic
,
and
the
result
are
startl
.
Combin
the
ironi
of
these
interview
with
Leuchter
's
reenact
and
reel
of
creepi
stock
footag
of
his
trip
to
Auschwitz
and
Birkenau
,
not
to
mention
a
haunt
clip
of
Thoma
Edison
electrocut
an
eleph
,
and
you
ve
got
one
compel
and
disturb
documentari
.
While
this
film
is
n't
for
the
feeble-mind
or
weak-heart
,
it
is
a
valuabl
addit
to
the
cultur
landscap
.
Aside
from
a
few
drag
minut
toward
the
end
of
the
piec
,
Morri
has
given
us
a
fresh
look
at
a
dismal
subject
and
I
,
for
one
,
feel
better
by
the
experi
.
