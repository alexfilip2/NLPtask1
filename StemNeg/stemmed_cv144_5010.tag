DEAD-BANG
,
an
action
thriller
star
Don
Johnson
,
live
up
to
it
dumb
titl
,
or
at
least
to
half
of
it
.
Although
DEAD-BANG
is
definit
dead
,
it
is
anyth
but
a
bang
;
in
fact
,
they
should
have
call
this
one
``
Dead
Bore
.
''
In
the
film
,
Johnson
play
...
you
guess
it
...
a
cop
.
The
role
must
have
been
realli
challeng
for
Johnson
sinc
his
charact
,
Jerri
Beck
,
is
a
gritti
Los
Angele
homicid
detect
,
a
real
stretch
from
the
slick
vice
detect
Johnson
portray
on
``
Miami
Vice
.
''
A
la
Mel
Gibson
in
LETHAL
WEAPON
,
Beck
is
an
emot
wreck
,
complet
with
violent
outburst
,
unscrupul
polic
method
,
and
a
bleak
outlook
on
life
.
Beck
's
wife
has
just
divorc
him
,
and
she
is
cut
him
off
from
their
children
.
She
will
not
even
allow
him
to
wish
them
``
Merri
Christma
''
by
telephon
.
But
Beck
's
famili
and
emot
problem
take
a
back
seat
to
the
action
and
thrill
in
DEAD-BANG
.
Beck
is
investig
the
brutal
murder
of
a
shopkeep
and
a
cop
.
His
investig
start
in
L.A.
and
final
culmin
and
climax
in
Oklahoma
,
where
he
has
a
violent
showdown
with
the
killer
at
a
white
supremacist
camp
.
Virtual
everi
aspect
of
DEAD-BANG
is
inept
and
ineffect
.
The
plot
is
incoher
and
full
of
hole
.
The
movi
depict
Beck
's
investig
so
clumsili
that
you
never
see
the
connect
between
his
clue
and
his
conclus
.
The
action
sequenc
in
DEAD-BANG
are
strict
third-rat
,
and
the
movi
has
absolut
no
momentum
or
suspens
.
I
certain
expect
more
from
long-tim
director
John
Frankenheim
who
direct
the
classic
polit
thriller
,
THE
MANCHURIAN
CANDIDATE
--
as
well
as
BLACK
SUNDAi
,
SEVEN
DAyS
IN
MAi
,
and
THE
FRENCH
CONNECTION
II
.
In
all
fair
to
Frankenheim
,
howev
,
I
should
note
that
most
of
DEAD-BANG
's
shortcom
seem
to
stem
from
it
shabbi
script
rather
than
from
the
direct
.
DEAD-BANG
tri
to
don
a
mask
of
social
relev
by
incorpor
theme
of
racism
and
white
supremaci
,
but
it
effort
are
noth
more
than
token
gestur
and
noth
less
than
insult
.
Accord
to
the
movi
's
product
note
,
DEAD-BANG
is
base
on
the
real-lif
experi
of
still-act
detect
Jerri
Beck
.
you
would
never
guess
this
from
watch
DEAD-BANG
,
howev
,
sinc
the
film
total
lack
credibl
;
it
is
utter
unconvinc
and
unbeliev
.
Most
of
the
charact
in
DEAD-BANG
are
either
atroci
act
,
underdevelop
,
superflu
,
or
all
of
the
abov
.
William
Forsyth
,
for
exampl
,
is
pain
bad
as
Arthur
Kressler
,
a
wholesom
by-the-book
FBI
agent
who
's
offend
by
Beck
's
foul
languag
and
unorthodox
method
.
Forsyth
's
lame
perform
and
corni
dialogu
make
his
charact
unbear
.
DEAD-BANG
mark
the
motion
pictur
debut
of
Tim
Reid
-LRB-
``
WKRP
In
Cincinnati
''
and
``
Frank
's
Place
''
-RRB-
,
but
his
talent
are
complet
wast
in
a
clich
and
contriv
role
;
he
play
the
chief
offic
of
a
squadron
of
black
cop
who
help
Beck
to
nail
the
villain
.
The
sole
function
of
Penelop
Ann
Miller
's
charact
is
to
give
DEAD-BANG
an
excus
to
includ
a
gratuit
love
scene
between
charact
about
whom
you
could
not
care
less
.
I
guess
the
film
's
titl
refer
to
this
love
scene
sinc
it
's
definit
a
dead
bang
.
The
onli
real
virtu
of
DEAD-BANG
,
believ
it
or
not
,
is
Don
Johnson
,
who
tri
to
overcom
the
limit
of
the
movi
's
piti
script
.
Johnson
succeed
in
give
his
charact
a
sarcast
sens
of
humor
and
a
hint
of
depth
,
and
his
pessimist
wisecrack
occasion
bring
the
film
to
life
.
And
I
must
admit
that
DEAD-BANG
doe
have
one
or
two
amus
moment
.
The
funniest
scene
has
Johnson
throwing-up
all
over
a
crimin
as
he
interrog
him
.
But
when
barf
is
the
highlight
of
a
movi
,
you
know
the
movi
's
in
troubl
.
The
other
amus
scene
involv
a
psycholog
examin
of
Beck
,
in
which
he
ca
n't
keep
a
straight
face
becaus
the
psychiatrist
resembl
Woodi
Allen
.
But
two
funni
scene
and
a
coupl
good
wisecrack
do
not
a
movi
make
.
