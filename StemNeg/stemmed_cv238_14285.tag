Beyer
wrote
the
critic
pan
``
B.A.P.S.
''
Now
she
make
her
directori
debut
,
write
,
direct
,
and
star
in
this
sub-par
film
about
women
talk
about
sex
.
Though
not
without
redeem
qualiti
,
this
film
is
bad
.
The
basic
stori
follow
three
singl
friend
--
Jazz
-LRB-
Beyer
-RRB-
,
Lena
-LRB-
Randi
Ingerman
-RRB-
,
and
Michell
-LRB-
Paget
Brewster
-RRB-
--
in
their
search
for
love
.
Jazz
has
an
idea
for
a
local
talk
show
;
it
would
featur
women
talk
about
sex
and
date
.
She
and
her
friend
make
a
demo
tape
of
interview
with
the
women
of
Miami
.
The
film
itself
is
sprinkl
with
these
real
interview
throughout
,
both
as
part
of
the
plot
and
as
commentari
on
the
situat
of
the
main
charact
.
The
fact
that
they
are
real
provid
a
refresh
break
from
some
of
the
more
melodramat
moment
in
the
film
.
There
are
sever
moment
of
bad
act
,
corni
dialogu
,
and
emot
overextens
.
In
a
low-budget
independ
film
from
a
first-tim
director
,
these
fault
can
sometim
be
forgiven
,
IF
the
screenplay
is
fresh
and
solid
.
That
is
not
the
case
here
.
The
script
suffer
from
random
plot
develop
.
There
are
four
or
five
of
these
turn
in
the
plot
,
each
one
rais
the
question
``
where
did
that
come
from
?
''
At
one
point
,
a
charact
has
a
lifelong
reconcili
with
her
mother
.
We
are
suppos
to
be
move
,
but
sinc
the
scene
is
complet
un-led-up
to
,
we
realli
do
n't
care
if
she
and
her
mother
get
along
.
We
ve
never
seen
her
mother
befor
.
We
never
see
her
again
.
Who
care
?
What
's
wors
,
these
sudden
develop
are
suppos
to
engag
our
sympathi
.
At
anoth
point
,
a
charact
announc
that
she
ca
n't
have
children
.
Apparent
,
this
is
devast
.
We
would
n't
know
this
becaus
she
never
talk
about
have
kid
befor
,
but
we
are
nevertheless
expect
to
be
devast
for
her
.
The
scene
feel
like
an
afterthought
,
it
emot
manipul
and
shallow
.
These
scene
grow
wors
and
wors
,
culmin
in
an
absurd
climax
.
Two
scene
were
play
with
such
overwhelm
melodrama
that
I
found
myself
laugh
.
One
scene
is
a
lover
's
spat
between
two
minor
charact
.
The
other
has
the
main
charact
express
their
copious
grief
by
clean
hous
in
wail
of
despair
and
cloud
of
Ajax
.
Think
on
these
scene
,
it
is
hard
for
me
to
admit
that
the
film
has
redeem
qualiti
.
But
it
doe
.
First
,
it
is
origin
.
We
men
often
wonder
what
women
talk
about
when
they
are
alon
in
group
,
and
I
imagin
this
film
give
me
a
pretti
good
idea
.
It
's
someth
I
do
n't
think
has
been
the
subject
of
a
film
.
Second
,
the
interview
of
the
Miami
women
are
sincer
.
Taken
togeth
,
they
form
a
mosaic
pictur
of
Miami
beachwalk
and
bistro
diner
.
The
mosaic
is
made
of
sound
bite
and
stereotyp
,
but
each
tile
is
some
woman
's
real
experi
.
Neither
the
pictur
of
women
,
nor
their
pictur
of
men
,
is
truli
repres
,
but
the
point
is
that
both
set
of
general
are
tell
in
their
own
way
.
At
some
level
,
the
stereotyp
that
emerg
can
be
call
true
.
I
can
imagin
some
peopl
like
this
film
when
it
charact
talk
about
their
``
like
,
dislik
,
skill
,
and
thrill
,
''
but
on
the
whole
,
it
's
pretti
bad
.
And
that
make
it
even
harder
to
forgiv
the
bad
act
,
corni
dialogu
,
and
emot
overextens
.
I
ll
give
Beyer
one
more
strike
,
and
then
she
's
out
.
Rate
R
-LRB-
almost
got
an
NC-17
-RRB-
for
explicit
sexual
dialogu
and
nuditi
.
