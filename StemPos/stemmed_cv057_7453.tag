I
had
been
expect
more
of
this
movi
than
the
less
than
thrill
TWISTER
.
TWISTER
was
good
but
had
no
real
plot
and
no
one
to
simpith
with
.
But
TWISTER
had
amaz
effect
and
I
was
hope
so
would
VOLCANO
Volcano
start
with
Tommi
Lee
Jone
at
EMO
.
He
worri
about
a
small
earthquak
enough
to
leav
his
daughter
at
home
with
a
babi
sitter
.
There
is
one
small
quak
then
anoth
quak
.
Then
a
geologist
point
out
to
Tommi
that
it
take
a
geolog
event
to
heat
million
of
gallon
of
water
in
12
hour
.
A
few
hour
later
larg
amount
of
ash
start
to
fall
.
Then
...
.
it
start
.
The
volcan
erupt
...
.
I
like
this
movi
...
but
it
was
not
as
great
as
I
hope
.
I
was
still
good
none
the
less
.
It
had
excel
special
effect
.
The
best
view
...
the
helecopt
fli
over
the
street
of
volcano
.
Also
...
there
were
interest
side
stori
that
made
the
plot
more
interest
.
So
...
It
was
good
!!
