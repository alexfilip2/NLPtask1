For
those
who
associ
Italian
cinema
with
Fellini
and
``
high
art
,
''
The
Son
's
Room
is
an
invent
,
subtl
altern
.
Written
by
,
direct
,
and
star
Nanni
Moretti
,
it
take
us
through
the
slow
,
complic
path
of
bereav
.
Slow
is
the
best
descript
for
the
film
at
first
.
It
take
it
time
in
establish
the
habit
of
what
appear
to
be
a
normal
,
happi
famili
.
Father
and
mother
both
work
but
still
find
the
time
to
support
their
son
and
daughter
through
homework
and
after
school
activ
.
They
laugh
,
spend
free
time
togeth
,
and
reprimand
the
kid
for
innoc
wrong
with
a
sigh
and
soft
pat
on
the
shoulder
.
you
get
the
feel
there
is
open
communic
and
uncondit
love
amongst
the
foursom
.
But
sudden
,
the
son
is
found
to
be
dead
after
a
dive
accid
.
The
famili
dynam
begin
an
unpredict
descent
that
give
the
narrat
strength
when
you
least
expect
it
,
but
can
also
be
tri
on
the
attent
span
.
Though
the
film
drag
and
even
repeat
itself
,
this
can
be
somewhat
excus
as
influenc
by
the
process
of
griev
.
Though
Nanni
Moretti
wore
sever
hat
for
this
product
,
it
doe
n't
come
across
as
a
vaniti
piec
.
One
might
wish
he
had
n't
pick
the
profess
of
analyst
for
the
father
,
Giovanni
-LRB-
which
he
star
as
-RRB-
,
if
onli
becaus
this
make
his
charact
's
reaction
so
predict
.
What
save
it
is
a
well
written
script
,
with
spare
dialogu
and
an
eclect
varieti
of
human
interact
.
The
potenc
of
the
film
lie
in
the
recreat
of
the
tini
detail
of
everyday
life
that
alter
due
to
the
death
of
a
close
relat
,
or
that
remind
a
depress
person
of
loss
.
you
start
to
take
notic
of
the
crack
dish
,
ignor
when
famili
bliss
was
in
full
swing
.
you
rememb
bond
dure
the
routin
jog
around
the
block
,
and
not
necessarili
huge
event
like
graduat
.
Even
better
are
the
role
revers
that
take
place
within
the
household
.
While
Giovanni
and
Paola
-LRB-
Laura
Morant
-RRB-
do
check
up
on
their
daughter
Irene
-LRB-
Jasmin
Trinca
-RRB-
,
there
is
a
sens
of
be
on
autopilot
.
Not
onli
doe
Irene
begin
to
take
care
of
her
own
need
more
,
she
ll
make
her
parent
breakfast
in
an
attempt
to
crack
their
new
shell
to
life
around
them
.
These
scene
provid
interest
portray
of
various
cope
mechan
,
frequent
cross
a
boundari
as
to
how
much
you
can
help
yourself
versus
other
dure
drastic
,
unexpect
chang
.
Respect
,
gender
issu
never
enter
the
pictur
.
Self-propel
isol
is
univers
in
term
of
deal
,
so
Moretti
intellig
use
this
tool
to
separ
the
famili
.
Though
Giovanni
doe
stop
Paolo
from
discuss
Andrea
at
a
parti
with
friend
,
there
is
never
a
sens
that
he
or
she
is
more
stoic
,
or
more
correct
in
the
search
to
restor
a
sens
of
a
balanc
to
their
live
.
Most
film
that
broach
the
topic
of
death
util
annoy
melodrama
,
speech
,
and
conciliatori
issu
to
get
the
waterwork
flow
.
In
contrast
,
The
Son
's
Room
captur
a
more
realist
depict
of
the
effect
of
death
on
a
famili
by
gracious
flow
among
the
five
stage
of
mourn
-LRB-
denial
,
depress
,
anger
,
bargain
,
accept
-RRB-
through
each
of
it
main
charact
.
It
's
not
the
most
engag
100
minut
,
but
it
is
certain
easi
to
relat
to
