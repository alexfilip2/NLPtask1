When

with

by
a
wild
Irish
gypsi

When

jump
on

Guy
Ritchi
-LRB-
Mr.
Madonna
to
some
-RRB-
is
an
extraordinarili
talent
auteur
who
has
a
wonder
knack
for
pull
togeth
his
uniqu
collect
of
cast
and
crew
and
feed
them
funni
and
gritti
dialog
that
spew
out
of
the
charact
'
mouth
like
machin
gun
fire
.
The
helmer
marshal
his
larg
ensembl
actor
in
a
frantic
pace
caper
comedi
that
make
you
laugh
and
feel
queasi
at
the
same
time
,
the
abov
descript
by
Brick
Top
be
just
one
exampl
.
The
assemblag
of
actor
and
non-actor
in
rough-and-tumbl
set
give
``
Snatch
''
an
earthi
feel
in
it
depict
of
London
's
crimin
underworld
.
The
cast
of
charact
is
too
larg
to
credit
here
,
but
two
of
the
performances-first
among
equal
,
you
might
say-ar
worth
note
.
Alan
Ford
is
brilliant
as
the
ruthless
,
evil
Brick
Top
.
When
he
refus
sugar
in
his
tea
becaus
``
I
'm
sweet
enough
,
''
it
make
you
shiver
,
even
as
you
laugh
.
His
is
one
of
the
best
gangster
charact
I
ve
seen
in
year
.
The
other
outstand
perf
is
given
by
none
other
than
Brad
Pitt
,
the
name
actor
the
movi
's
popular
may
hang
upon
,
at
least
initi
.
Pitt
,
as
Mickey
O'Neil
,
is
hard
drink
,
hard
fight
,
high
unreli
and
near
incomprehens
with
a
uniqu
Irish
brogu
and
dialect
of
the
piker
,
the
Irish
travel
of
Europ
.
This
gypsi
brigand
would
steal
the
fill
from
your
teeth
,
especi
if
it
would
benefit
his
belov
mum
-LRB-
Sorcha
Cusack
-RRB-
.
When
Brick
Top
threaten
the
safeti
of
Mickey
's
famili
,
he
make
an
enemi
that
can
not
be
stop
.
Pitt
put
a
credibl
spin
on
his
charact
and
doe
some
incred
physic
stuff
,
too
,
as
a
bare-knuckl
boxer
.
The
product
team
behind
the
camera
includ
Ritchi
alumni
,
produc
Matthew
Vaughn
and
lenser
Tim
Maurice-Jon
,
and
other
talent
technic
artist
that
bring
the
hyperact
imagin
of
the
author
to
visual
life
.
There
is
a
patent
feel
to
the
look
of
``
Snatch
''
and
``
Lock
,
Stock
and
Two
Smoke
Barrel
''
that
reek
of
``
signatur
''
for
Ritchi
,
but
I
'm
not
sure
how
this
will
translat
in
his
futur
work
.
There
is
so
much
talent
in
the
filmmak
that
I
would
like
to
see
him
branch
out
in
other
direct
.
Nonetheless
,
``
Snatch
''
is
terrif
sophomor
effort
,
a
darn
good
action
comedi
and
a
hoot
to
boot
.
