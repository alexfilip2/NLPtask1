When
peopl
are
talk
about
good
old
time
,
they
actual
want
to
make
some
bad
time
look
better
.
Nice
exampl
of
such
behaviour
is
contemporari
attitud
of
popular
media
toward
the
1970s
.
For
new
generat
,
Superseventi
are
the
lost
Golden
Age
of
chic
fashion
,
cult
TV
show
and
sexual
freedom
uncheck
by
AIDS
.
For
peopl
who
actual
had
to
live
in
that
period
,
it
was
the
Gloomi
Decad
,
mark
by
lost
ideal
of
1968
,
rampant
inflat
and
unemploy
,
intern
terror
,
fuel
crisi
and
loss
of
faith
in
almost
anyth
that
previous
generat
stood
for
.
Feel
of
despair
and
nihil
found
it
reflect
in
mani
film
of
that
era
.
Martin
Scorses
's
TAXI
DRIVER
,
which
symbolis
both
the
glori
and
despair
of
the
Seventi
,
is
most
celebr
of
them
all
.
The
movi
's
protagonist
is
Travi
Bickl
-LRB-
Robert
de
Niro
-RRB-
,
26-year
old
former
Marin
who
take
the
job
of
taxi
driver
in
New
york
Citi
becaus
he
ca
n't
sleep
at
night
.
The
job
get
him
expos
to
the
dark
side
of
apocalypt
megalopoli
,
and
Travi
gradual
get
alien
from
the
rest
of
world
.
The
onli
bright
spot
in
his
life
is
Betsi
-LRB-
Cybil
Sheperd
-RRB-
,
attract
woman
work
in
Senat
Palantin
's
presidenti
campaign
.
Their
date
end
as
humili
fiasco
becaus
Travi
make
fatal
mistak
by
invit
her
to
porno
movi
theatr
.
Lose
his
onli
link
to
better
side
of
the
world
,
Travi
gradual
descend
into
psychosi
,
becom
convinc
that
his
mission
in
life
is
to
battl
scum
on
the
street
.
He
purchas
a
formid
arsenal
of
gun
and
begin
physic
prepar
for
the
inevit
conflict
.
That
conflict
final
come
when
he
take
person
interest
in
Iris
-LRB-
Jodi
Foster
-RRB-
,
12-year
old
prostitut
who
temporarili
took
refug
in
his
taxi
.
As
mani
great
movi
that
got
cult
status
through
the
year
,
TAXI
DRIVER
becam
the
object
of
mani
interpret
.
For
some
critic
and
scholar
it
is
an
explor
of
univers
subject
that
date
back
to
Dostoyevski-loss
of
moral
compass
in
a
bleak
realiti
of
dirti
,
overpopul
industri
citi
;
the
stori
could
have
been
set
in
19th
Centuri
same
as
in
our
time
.
For
other
,
the
movi
use
Raskolnikov-lik
figur
in
order
to
portray
burn
problem
of
1970s
America-it
appar
inabl
to
deal
with
the
consequ
of
rapid
social
chang
that
occur
in
previous
decad
.
Brilliant
perform
of
Robert
De
Niro
in
role
of
a
lifetim
can
give
argument
for
both
side
.
His
Travi
Bickl
has
a
lot
in
common
with
most
of
the
averag
viewer
of
today-mani
of
us
share
his
feel
of
isol
,
loneli
and
outrag
toward
crime
,
drug
,
prostitut
and
senseless
street
violenc
.
His
pathet
attempt
to
establish
some
kind
of
human
connect
with
the
peopl
around
him
,
sometim
in
most
unusu
circumstances-lik
with
Secret
Servic
agent
,
pimp
or
job
interviewers-mak
him
a
person
too
goofi
to
be
the
hero
,
and
too
pathet
to
be
the
classic
villain
.
Howev
,
most
of
the
averag
viewer
are
sensibl
enough
to
recognis
the
tin
line
that
separ
concern
citizen
or
troubl
soul
from
fanat
madmen
.
But
despit
anyth
,
averag
viewer
at
the
end
actual
cheer
for
Travis-hi
crusad
against
``
scum
''
is
someth
that
averag
person
want
,
but
doe
n't
have
a
stomach/lack
of
brain
to
do
it
.
While
De
Niro
's
Travi
might
come
in
and
out
of
particular
time
and
place
,
other
person
that
appear
in
the
film
-LRB-
most
play
by
the
charact
actor
-RRB-
give
it
distinct
1970s
feel
.
Wizzard
-LRB-
play
by
Peter
Boyl
-RRB-
present
the
onli
link
with
America
's
better
past
;
but
onli
becaus
he
is
the
oldest
taxi
driver
in
compani
and
therefor
everybodi
assum
that
he
``
know
stuff
''
.
His
obvious
inadequaci
in
give
advic
to
troubl
Travi
illustr
the
inabl
of
pre-1960
generat
to
find
answer
to
the
problem
of
Gloomi
Decad
.
Other
charact
,
on
the
other
hand
,
show
the
bad
side
of
New
Age
.
Matthew
``
Sport
''
-LRB-
Keitel
,
who
befriend
real-lif
pimp
in
other
to
prepar
for
his
role
of
a
lifetim
-RRB-
is
dress
like
a
hippi
;
Iris
found
excus
for
her
escap
to
the
world
of
drug
and
child
prostitut
in
a
ideolog
of
Countercultur
.
Porno
movi
,
that
should
be
the
element
of
new
time
of
sexual
freedom
,
are
too
much
even
for
suppos
``
liber
''
Betsi
.
Even
the
politician
,
like
Senat
Palantin
,
are
lost
in
post-Vietnam
and
post-Waterg
mess
;
his
broad
and
senseless
``
messag
''
that
cover
the
lack
of
ani
serious
program
ca
n't
fool
even
such
idiot
like
Travi
.
The
Past
is
gone
,
The
Present
is
bad
,
and
even
The
Futur
seem
bleak
,
and
the
feel
of
pessim
ca
n't
be
wash
away
even
by
iron
happi
end
.
Travi
and
his
world
found
themselv
in
a
desper
situat
,
and
Martin
Scorses
use
the
best
of
his
cinemat
skill
in
order
to
spill
the
gloom
of
Schrader
's
screenplay
into
the
silver
screen
.
New
york
Citi
in
the
night
is
portray
as
a
Hell
on
Earth
,
and
the
red
light
and
steam
come
out
of
sewer
give
it
surreal
,
almost
Stygian
atmospher
.
Another
import
element
of
the
atmospher
is
score
of
great
Bernard
Herrman
,
whose
effici
use
of
jazz
element
give
some
melancholi
that
soften
the
brutal
of
motion
pictur
.
One
of
the
greatest
ironi
of
TAXI
DRIVER
is
the
fact
that
the
movi
was
,
same
as
his
protagonist
,
famous
for
the
wrong
reason
.
Instead
of
receiv
cult
status
becaus
of
his
artist
merit
,
for
mani
year
it
was
tabloid-fodd
becaus
of
Hinckley
and
his
real-lif
re-enact
of
event
in
the
movi
.
Now
,
more
than
two
decad
later
,
when
some
other
``
life
imit
art
''
incid
get
more
attent
,
we
can
final
enjoy
TAXI
DRIVER
in
all
it
artist
glori
.
