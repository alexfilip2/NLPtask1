We
go
into
a
movi
theater
,
boom
!
the
light
go
down
,
our
heart
race
,
we
go
through
ten
minut
of
preview
and
final
the
movi
we
ve
been
wait
to
see
for
a
long
time
come
on
.
We
sit
there
,
watch
in
disbelief
that
this
movi
is
as
bad
as
it
is
.
Whi
should
n't
I
have
know
what
I
was
get
myself
into
.
Again
like
this
past
summer
hit
``
Stigmata
''
,
``
End
of
Day
''
may
be
wors
.
It
's
not
like
this
is
ani
kind
of
origin
idea
,
it
just
throw
in
some
``
Rosemari
's
Babi
''
,
along
with
``
The
Devil
's
Advocat
''
a
littl
``
Exorcist
''
and
some
``
Stigmata
''
here
and
there
.
Whala
you
have
``
End
of
Day
''
a
movi
that
is
extrem
disappoint
and
by
the
preview
made
it
look
terrif
.
Sad
but
truli
again
like
most
recent
film
,
all
the
good
part
are
in
the
trailer
.
The
plot
which
is
veri
confus
at
time
is
also
veri
ludicr
and
the
movi
is
destin
to
be
a
hit
in
the
first
weekend
,
and
flop
in
the
next
.
Jericho
Cane
-LRB-
Arnold
Schwarzneggar
in
hit
typic
macho
role
-RRB-
is
a
cop
who
find
out
that
he
is
chosen
to
track
down
Satan
-LRB-
Live
in
Gabriel
Byrn
bodi
-RRB-
and
stop
him
from
impregn
Christin
york
-LRB-
Robin
Tunney
-RRB-
becaus
if
he
doe
,
and
she
give
birth
all
exist
as
we
know
it
will
ceas
to
exist
.
He
has
to
do
this
befor
it
turn
into
the
year
2000
,
and
strang
he
's
tri
to
fight
him
5
minut
befor
2000
come
.
He
seek
help
from
the
Cathol
church
and
help
from
Rod
Stieger
-LRB-
in
a
terrif
role
-RRB-
and
tri
to
save
this
girl
lead
to
an
end
that
's
satisfi
,
but
turn
into
a
typic
action
movi
.
That
's
pretti
much
it
on
plot
.
It
doe
have
the
razzl
and
dazzl
of
a
great
action
movi
,
and
with
the
100
m
dollar
budget
part
seem
to
show
it
,
part
you
have
to
wonder
where
all
the
money
went
.
As
for
Arnie
?
Good
role
,
OK
perform
.
I
think
sinc
he
is
get
a
littl
older
he
is
held
back
a
lot
of
his
stunt
.
The
thing
that
disappoint
me
was
the
fact
that
there
was
noth
to
the
film
.
In
the
trailer
it
look
like
a
good
scari
,
action
film
and
end
up
be
a
bore
,
long
and
preposter
drama
that
lead
into
someth
els
that
leav
us
with
question
.
Gabriel
Byrn
-LRB-
who
iron
play
a
priest
in
``
Stigmata
''
-RRB-
here
play
Satan
and
give
a
good
perform
but
again
seem
held
back
and
not
into
his
charact
.
Two
year
back
Al
Pacino
gave
a
terrif
perform
in
the
fun
``
The
Devil
's
Advocat
''
and
here
it
seem
like
the
idea
of
him
is
in
the
charact
also
.
Robin
Tunney
-LRB-
great
perform
as
alway
-RRB-
play
Satan
's
main
person
whom
he
want
to
impregn
to
carri
his
child
.
Of
cours
Rod
Stieger
give
anoth
great
perform
which
realli
is
n't
noth
new
.
The
direct
by
Peter
Hyam
is
at
time
a
bit
overblown
,
though
not
near
as
the
visual
style
was
in
``
Stigmata
''
.
Here
we
are
given
great
camera
work
,
and
some
great
scene
that
are
terrif
direct
but
sad
just
do
n't
work
in
this
movi
.
The
script
written
by
Andrew
Marlow
has
a
few
witti
line
,
but
again
the
movi
is
all
style
and
no
substanc
and
by
the
end
final
climax
I
was
readi
to
go
home
.
Onli
a
few
thing
work
here
and
those
are
a
few
of
the
perform
,
the
write
and
visual
style
,
but
the
storylin
and
the
finish
product
do
n't
work
as
well
.
The
sad
thing
is
that
``
End
of
Day
''
had
so
mani
thing
go
for
it
.
The
plot
could
have
been
more
organ
,
the
action
scene
could
have
been
more
braini
and
less
mind-numb
.
At
time
it
seem
like
``
Armageddon
''
and
start
to
get
old
and
tiresom
.
Hollywood
is
run
out
of
idea
bad
,
and
like
I
ve
alway
said
befor
need
new
one
.
Even
with
it
100
m
budget
``
End
of
Day
''
is
less
than
pleas
.
In
fact
the
100
m
dollar
budget
is
at
least
30
m
over
,
and
easili
could
have
had
a
70
m
budget
.
Mayb
I
sound
crazi
,
but
I
am
realli
look
forward
to
the
new
Exorcist
film
,
and
hope
that
they
make
it
as
good
as
the
origin
.
We
need
to
get
new
idea
and
stop
recycl
old
one
just
to
make
money
at
the
box-offic
.
We
need
to
get
more
film
like
``
The
Blair
Witch
Project
''
that
could
scare
peopl
to
death
,
while
peopl
think
well
what
exact
is
scare
them
and
how
do
I
know
that
it
is
in
fact
The
Blair
Witch
.
Overblown
effect
,
stupid
and
thin
plot-lin
,
good
perform
,
disappoint
...
.
umm
yup
those
pretti
much
describ
``
End
of
Day
''
.
