Ever
watch
a
veri
young
child
tri
and
tell
a
joke
that
is
beyond
his
,
or
her
,
sophist
?
It
's
full
of
stop
and
start
and
usual
,
the
punch
line
is
ruin
.
I
felt
the
same
way
watch
Drown
Mona
.
Skip
a
stone
across
water
and
you
approxim
the
depth
of
this
attempt
at
an
ensembl
comedi
.
There
are
some
slight
success
attempt
at
humor
,
but
they
onli
serv
as
window
dress
.
There
is
a
run
gag
about
the
town
,
Verplanck
,
N.y.
,
be
a
test
town
for
the
then
new
yugo
.
Everyon
drive
a
yugo
,
differenti
their
car
with
person
licens
plate
.
Even
the
Polic
chief
drive
one
.
There
is
a
certain
sublim
to
the
imag
of
a
light
and
siren
deck
out
yugo
skitter
it
way
through
the
town
street
.
There
also
is
a
run
gag
about
one
of
the
charact
,
Jeff
,
miss
a
hand
and
how
it
occur
.
It
poke
gentl
fun
at
the
notion
of
urban
legend
.
It
turn
out
the
truth
is
more
horrifi
than
ani
legend
.
There
are
some
sight
gag
that
pop
up
as
well
,
such
as
Mona
's
tombston
,
which
read
``
demot
''
,
instead
of
devot
.
Still
,
The
core
of
the
stori
maintain
the
flat
of
a
still
pond
.
The
lynchpin
of
the
film
fall
on
the
redund
and
sporad
scene
involv
Mona
-LRB-
Midler
-RRB-
.
Each
scene
with
her
is
the
same
:
scream
at
someon
,
hit
someon
,
then
scream
some
more
.
There
's
no
uniqu
or
modul
to
her
or
explan
for
her
mean
.
Anyon
off
the
street
could
have
play
the
role
,
such
as
it
is
.
The
other
charact
are
walk
cardboard
cutout
.
Each
one
is
defin
by
one
trait
and
no
further
attempt
is
made
at
deeper
character
.
There
is
a
bur
,
femal
car
mechan
,
so
of
cours
,
there
is
a
forc
lesbian
gag
.
Mona
's
son
,
Jeff
-LRB-
Marcus
Thoma
-RRB-
is
a
simpleton
,
henc
you
can
predict
his
dialogu
befor
it
even
plod
it
way
from
his
mouth
.
Chief
of
Polic
Rash
-LRB-
Devito
-RRB-
like
Broadway
music
and
love
his
daughter
.
There
's
noth
more
to
him
.
Elle
,
the
chief
's
daughter
-LRB-
Campbel
-RRB-
,
is
bland
personifi
,
a
duti
girl
with
no
higher
aspir
than
to
have
a
child
and
be
marri
.
Mona
's
husband
Phil
-LRB-
Fichtner
-RRB-
Jeckl
and
Hyde
from
shirk
coward
to
reptilian
letch
.
Bob
-LRB-
Affleck
-RRB-
,
Elle
's
betroth
,
and
busi
partner
to
Jeff
,
is
a
mumbl
,
obvious
dullard
.
There
is
no
contrast
to
ani
of
the
charact
.
By
have
at
least
one
charact
with
some
wit
,
or
wit
,
to
serv
as
counterpoint
to
the
other
,
perhap
Steinfeld
's
attempt
at
satir
a
small
town
infest
with
ambitionless
peopl
might
have
come
off
better
.
Ostensibl
a
murder
mysteri
,
Drown
Mona
give
you
almost
all
the
clue
immedi
,
then
let
you
sit
back
and
feel
superior
as
you
watch
the
cast
of
paper
peopl
fumbl
their
way
to
find
the
killer
,
who
could
be
anyon
due
to
Mona
's
love
manner
with
everyon
on
town
.
Even
that
aspect
of
the
film
fail
,
throw
in
a
conveni
,
ridicul
and
unsatisfi
wrap
to
thing
.
It
's
been
a
while
sinc
I
walk
away
from
a
movi
theater
in
an
angri
mood
.
What
make
it
all
the
more
remark
is
that
I
rare
rememb
a
comedi
make
me
so
angri
for
wast
my
time
at
it
's
ineptitud
.
