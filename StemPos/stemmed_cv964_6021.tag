you
ve
got
to
think
twice
befor
you
go
see
a
movi
with
a
titl
like
MAXIMUM
RISK
.
The
titl
is
generic
.
It
's
meaningless
.
And
I
ca
n't
believ
it
's
good
busi
.
When
you
pick
up
the
phone
and
dial
777-FILM
,
how
in
the
world
are
you
suppos
to
rememb
that
the
new
Jean-Claud
Van
Damm
movi
,
the
one
that
look
kind
of
cool
in
the
trailer
and
is
direct
by
some
Chines
hot
shot
,
is
call
,
geez
,
MAXIMUM
RISK
?
yuck
.
The
movi
itself
deserv
your
attent
.
For
sweet
bloodi
thrill
,
this
one
beat
the
summer
blockbust
competit
hands-down
.
Onli
MISSION
:
IMPOSSIBLE
came
close
to
deliv
as
skill
a
thriller
,
and
I
ll
give
Maximum
Risk
the
edg
simpli
becaus
it
's
not
as
slick
as
the
Tom
Cruis
pictur
,
and
therefor
more
gratifi
in
it
execut
.
Much
to
my
surpris
,
Van
Damm
continu
to
develop
as
a
pleasant
,
unpretenti
action
hero
.
His
track
record
is
n't
as
solid
as
Schwarzenegg
's
,
but
he
's
a
hell
of
a
lot
more
adventur
than
Arnold
.
In
1993
,
Van
Damm
work
with
Hong
Kong
's
premier
hardcor
action
director
,
John
Woo
,
on
a
fair
lame
movi
call
HARD
TARGET
.
-LRB-
If
you
can
find
a
bootleg
copi
,
Woo
's
radic
differ
director
's
cut
is
much
better
than
what
was
eventu
releas
.
-RRB-
This
follow-up
is
direct
by
Ringo
Lam
-LRB-
CITi
ON
FIRE
,
FULL
CONTACT
-RRB-
,
whose
Hong
Kong
film
are
distinguish
action
pictur
that
have
consist
play
second
fiddl
to
Woo
's
more
operat
offer
.
The
surpris
here
is
that
MAXIMUM
RISK
is
a
more
effect
Hollywood
action
flick
than
either
HARD
TARGET
or
Woo
's
subsequ
BROKEN
ARROW
.
Here
's
the
rundown
.
Van
Damm
play
a
French
cop
name
Alain
Moreau
who
is
shaken
when
a
policeman
friend
-LRB-
Jean-Hugu
Anglade
-RRB-
find
a
corps
that
's
Alain
's
exact
doubl
.
Turn
out
Alain
was
separ
at
birth
from
his
twin
brother
,
Michael
,
who
has
been
kill
by
some
Russian
heavi
-LRB-
and
some
strang
American
look
cop
-RRB-
.
Alain
doe
some
investig
.
He
find
that
Michael
had
book
a
flight
to
New
york
Citi
,
and
receiv
a
messag
from
someon
there
name
Alex
Bohemia
.
Assume
Michael
's
ident
,
Alain
fli
to
New
york
and
get
tangl
up
with
Michael
's
girlfriend
-LRB-
Natasha
Henstridg
-RRB-
,
the
FBI
,
and
the
Russian
mob
in
Littl
Odessa
.
That
's
as
much
as
you
need
to
know
.
The
stori
is
adequ
,
but
not
over
involv
--
and
the
major
plot
point
are
basic
explain
to
you
twice
,
just
in
case
you
go
out
for
popcorn
at
the
wrong
moment
.
There
's
a
love
stori
,
too
,
but
I
did
n't
find
it
terribl
convinc
,
part
becaus
ex-model
Henstridg
is
too
high-strung
in
her
high-profil
debut
-LRB-
she
had
precious
few
line
as
the
alien
ice
queen
in
SPECIES
-RRB-
.
She
's
great
to
look
at
,
and
she
can
certain
read
a
line
,
but
what
she
doe
here
ca
n't
realli
be
describ
as
``
act
.
''
Of
cours
,
``
act
''
is
n't
realli
what
she
was
hire
for
-LRB-
I
lost
track
of
whether
her
shirt
come
off
more
often
than
Van
Damm
's
-RRB-
.
The
movi
is
except
violent
,
border
on
gratuiti
.
-LRB-
Keep
that
in
mind
when
plan
your
date
.
-RRB-
The
stunt
are
spectacular
,
and
the
fact
that
you
can
spot
Van
Damm
's
stand-in
make
his
work
no
less
impress
.
There
's
onli
so
much
you
can
do
with
a
car
wreck
,
but
this
movi
make
crisp
,
effect
use
of
pile-up
in
a
hand
of
frenzi
destruct
derbi
.
And
Lam
has
a
surpris
,
innov
sens
of
exact
where
the
camera
should
go
to
catch
ani
bit
of
action
.
The
main
differ
between
Lam
and
Woo
,
I
believ
,
is
that
while
Woo
reli
on
sheer
spectacl
to
gas
up
his
action
show
piec
,
Lam
has
figur
out
more
about
use
cinemat
space
and
double-barrel
point
of
view
to
make
thing
run
.
Do
n't
get
me
wrong
--
when
Chow
yun-Fat
soar
through
space
pump
bullet
out
of
two
pistol
and
chew
on
a
toothpick
with
glass
and
confetti
litter
the
air
around
him
in
Woo
's
HARD-BOILED
,
it
's
an
amaz
moment
.
But
it
's
a
moment
that
's
hard
to
reproduc
in
Hollywood
.
-LRB-
For
one
thing
,
Hollywood
doe
n't
yet
have
Chow
yun-Fat
!
-RRB-
While
Woo
's
Hollywood
movi
look
like
the
work
of
a
talent
upstart
,
MAXIMUM
RISK
is
a
surpris
confid
pictur
.
The
veri
first
shot
of
the
film
is
an
awkward
overhead
view
of
a
chase
through
the
street
of
a
European
citi
,
but
Lam
's
use
of
odd
camera
angl
becom
more
effici
later
on
.
The
film
edit
is
a
particular
savvi
complement
to
Lam
's
shoot
style
,
accentu
rather
than
amplifi
the
action
.
The
perform
could
have
use
some
fine
tune
-LRB-
in
particular
,
there
's
an
annoy
,
overwritten
Manhattan
cab
driver
in
the
earli
scene
who
should
have
been
tone
down
or
jettison
complet
-RRB-
,
and
the
movi
doe
n't
alway
overcom
the
limit
of
it
genr
.
The
stori
is
a
littl
mundan
,
although
there
are
some
effect
moment
involv
Van
Damm
's
unrequit
feel
toward
the
brother
he
never
knew
he
had
.
But
it
's
not
often
that
Hollywood
crank
out
a
truli
satisfi
action
pictur
,
and
it
's
doubli
surpris
that
this
one
should
come
with
a
mere
whisper
of
public
.
Van
Damm
fan
should
treat
themselv
to
what
may
well
be
the
man
's
best
movi
,
and
intern
action
buff
will
no
doubt
savor
this
flavor
Hong
Kong/Hollywood
hybrid
.
