STREETS
OF
FIRE
bill
itself
as
``
A
Rock
And
Roll
Fabl
''
,
and
the
descript
is
perfect
.
This
is
a
stylish
,
great-look
,
and
breezili
enjoy
movi
that
feel
like
a
Hubert
Selbi
,
Jr.
,
novel
with
a
Damon
Runyan
rewrit
,
irect
by
Bruce
Springsteen
.
Noir
is
one
of
the
few
truli
American
movi
genr
,
asid
from
the
Hollywood
music
and
the
Western
.
This
is
post-WWII
Brooklyn
noir
,
for
lack
of
a
better
label
,
with
a
generous
inject
of
rock
'n
roll
and
an
all-around
confront
attitud
.
It
all
work
.
The
plot
is
simplic
itself
:
Rocker
Ellen
Aim
-LRB-
Dian
Lane
-RRB-
is
kidnap
by
a
vicious
street
gang
,
led
by
a
bloodthirsti
fellow
name
Raven
-LRB-
Willem
Dafo
,
veri
nasti
-RRB-
.
Her
old
soldier
flame
-LRB-
play
by
Michael
Pare
-RRB-
come
back
into
town
to
save
her
,
but
doe
n't
count
on
a
whole
bunch
of
thing
go
askew
.
That
's
about
the
entir
plot
,
save
for
the
spat
with
Ellen
's
manag
-LRB-
a
hilari
Rick
Morani
-RRB-
,
an
encount
with
a
doo-wop
group
that
wind
up
becom
Ellen
's
support
act
,
and
a
whole
gang
of
other
fun
littl
touch
.
But
in
movi
like
this
,
when
is
the
plot
import
?
The
movi
is
all
style
,
all
visual
and
attitud
,
quotabl
line
and
postur
--
and
it
deliv
all
those
thing
consist
and
with
great
brio
and
pace
.
No
surpris
that
it
was
direct
by
Walter
Hill
-LRB-
48
HRS
.
-RRB-
,
who
understand
this
kind
of
macho
romantic
perfect
,
and
has
put
togeth
a
movi
that
's
a
mixtur
of
time
and
sensibl
,
but
perfect
unifi
in
tone
.
When
was
the
last
time
you
could
say
someth
like
that
about
a
movi
,
especi
a
movi
where
it
seem
like
someon

deck
on
the
jaw
-LRB-

and

pass
out
-RRB-
everi
2.63
minut
on
cue
?

but
