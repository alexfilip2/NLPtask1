Runningminut
Hollywood
has
realli
done
the
whole
Dracula
thing
to
death
-LRB-
no
pun
intended-honest
-RRB-
.
It
's
a
shame
,
too
,
becaus
the
good
Count
was
probabl
the
most
frighten
out
the
old
B-movi
monster
.
I
mean
,
come
on
.
Are
peopl
realli
go
to
get
that
scare
over
a
big
green
guy
name
Frankenstein
that
move
at
a
speed
of
five
mile
per
hour
?
Hell
no
.
And
not
onli
was
the
idea
of
a
vampir
frighten
as
hell
,
but
it
also
carri
with
it
a
kind
of
sensual
feel
as
well
,
not
common
associ
with
horror
film
.
And
not
onli
has
the
idea
been
done
too
mani
time
,
but
with
the
possibl
except
of
From
Dusk
Till
Dawn
,
has
not
been
done
veri
well
late
,
either
.
This
is
precis
whi
it
was
so
much
fun
for
me
watch
the
origin
Nosferatu
.
I
got
to
go
back
to
the
time
when
make
movi
-LRB-
even
horror
movi
-RRB-
was
consid
an
art
form
,
and
not
just
done
to
make
cash
like
nowaday
.
And
that
is
exact
what
this
film
is
;
art
.
I
ve
been
a
horror
fan
sinc
I
was
eight
year
old
,
and
to
this
day
I
have
not
seen
ani
horror
film
cover
the
intellectu
ground
that
this
film
cover
.
Let
me
backtrack
a
minut
.
When
I
say
``
intellectu
ground
''
,
I
do
n't
mean
that
Nosferatu
tackl
philosoph
question
or
anyth
like
that
,
I
just
mean
that
in
order
for
the
film
to
work
the
way
it
was
intend
to
,
a
littl
bit
of
think
is
involv
.
With
most
modern
slasher
movi
like
Friday
the
13th
and
what-not
,
you
can
just
simpli
sit
back
in
your
chair
and
be
frighten
by
the
gore
that
is
shown
.
Those
movi
could
have
been
made
by
a
fifth
grader
with
a
good
makeup
kit
;
movi
like
this
requir
the
viewer
to
actual
pay
attent
and
ponder
what
is
happen
on
the
screen
.
you
see
,
this
movi
has
bare
ani
violenc
in
it
and
even
less
blood
or
gore
.
This
is
a
think
man
's
slasher
flick
.
The
``
Nosferatu
''
of
the
titl
is
Orlock
-LRB-
Max
Shreck
-RRB-
,
a
strang
,
hermit-lik
count
that
,
as
the
film
open
,
is
look
for
a
new
home
to
buy
.
He
employ
the
help
of
Hutter
-LRB-
Gustav
von
Wangenhein
-RRB-
,
a
real
estat
salesman
-LRB-
or
someth
to
that
effect
-RRB-
who
has
a
nice
home
and
even
a
fiance
name
Ellen
-LRB-
Greta
Schroeder
-RRB-
.
Upon
order
from
his
boss
,
Hutter
trek
to
the
Transylvanian
Mountain
to
visit
Orlock
's
castl
and
speak
to
him
about
his
new
home
-LRB-
which
just
happen
to
be
right
next
door
to
Hutter
's
-RRB-
.
The
next
morn
,
he
wake
up
to
find
teeth
mark
on
his
neck
...
not
realli
a
good
sign
.
He
then
discov
through
some
read
that
the
count
is
a
``
Nosferatu
''
,
or
vampir
,
one
of
the
undead
that
feed
off
the
blood
of
live
human
.
But
by
the
time
he
piec
this
togeth
,
he
is
too
late
;
Orlock
has
alreadi
embark
to
Hutter
's
hometown
via
boat
.
Will
Hutter
reach
his
destin
in
time
to
save
his
fiance
from
the
dead
clutch
of
Count
Orlock
?
The
charact
of
Orlock
is
,
of
cours
,
Dracula
.
The
onli
onli
reason
his
name
was
chang
was
becaus
this
was
an
unauthor
account
of
Bram
Strocker
's
novel
.
Just
thought
that
was
an
interest
littl
side
note
...
Probabl
the
onli
way
you
will
get
to
see
this
fine
film
is
by
purchas
a
copi
of
Arrow
Entertain
's
digit
restor
cut
,
now
avail
in
store
.
Howev
,
this
version
is
quit
differ
than
Maunau
's
origin
masterpiec
.
The
movi
is
now
sport
a
new
soundtrack
by
band
Type
O-Negat
and
color
tint
,
much
like
the
1984
version
of
Lang
's
Metropoli
.
Now
,
I
realli
appreci
what
Arrow
Entertain
is
tri
to
do
here
,
bring
a
classic
like
this
to
the
attent
of
a
wider
audienc
that
might
have
otherwis
just
skip
this
one
.
But
ala
,
I
like
watch
movi
the
way
they
were
origin
intend
to
be
seen
.
But
that
's
just
my
bag
;
you
may
like
the
newer
,
more
``
modern
''
version
better
.
Either
way
,
I
suggest
invest
your
money
in
a
copi
.
If
you
like
what
they
have
done
with
it
,
pop
it
in
the
VCR
and
enjoy
.
If
you
re
like
me
,
just
do
what
I
ll
do
dure
futur
view
;
turn
the
color
all
the
way
down
on
your
televis
,
hit
mute
,
turn
on
some
Bach
or
Mozart
or
whatev
,
dim
the
light
and
prepar
to
view
what
is
truli
one
of
the
greatest
film
ever
made
.
