I
still
ca
n't
figur
out
whi
peopl
went
in
drove
to
see
this
movi
.
Now
befor
you
go
assum
I
'm
some
sort
of
high
brow
snob
,
who
ca
n't
appreci
a
littl
dumb
humor
,
let
me
say
that
I
love
cheap
humor
.
I
thought
There
's
Someth
About
Mari
was
one
of
the
funniest
film
that
I
have
ever
seen
and
it
was
certain
one
of
the
best
film
of
1998
.
Low
brow
adolesc
humor
can
be
a
lot
of
fun
,
the
problem
with
The
Waterboy
is
that
it
is
just
low
brow
and
adolesc
,
there
is
no
humor
compon
.
I
want
to
like
The
Waterboy
,
I
realli
did
.
I
think
I
onli
laugh
maybeortim
throughout
the
entir
movi
.
Actualli
,
I
smile
a
coupl
of
more
time
on
top
of
that
.
Not
a
great
record
for
a
90-minut
film
.
The
problem
with
The
Waterboy
is
the
same
as
most
other
Adam
Sandler
movi
.
Those
respons
for
this
mess
seem
to
think
that
the
sheer
fact
that
Sandler
walk
around
use
a
goofi
voic
and
play
dumb
the
entir
movi
is
a
substitut
for
actual
funni
materi
.
Noth
could
be
further
from
the
truth
,
as
matter
of
fact
,
Sandler
's
idiot
voic
start
to
get
on
my
nerv
at
point
in
this
film
.
It
's
realli
a
shame
too
,
becaus
this
film
had
the
potenti
to
be
veri
funni
.
I
person
believ
that
Sandler
is
probabl
a
veri
talent
comedian
,
it
's
just
that
so
far
he
has
n't
been
abl
to
find
the
right
film
to
showcas
his
talent
.
If
his
onli
talent
is
make
goofi
voic
and
play
moron
,
my
guess
is
that
his
career
in
the
movi
will
go
down
the
same
road
as
the
vast
major
of
the
former
star
of
Saturday
Night
Live
.
Most
of
whom
are
now
happili
no
longer
in
the
entertain
industri
.
Sandler
play
a
31-year-old
,
somewhat
mental
challeng
,
waterboy
for
a
colleg
footbal
team
.
The
team
's
somewhat
mental
disturb
coach
-LRB-
Henri
Winkler
-RRB-
realiz
that
his
waterboy
has
a
great
deal
of
pent-up
rage
,
which
,
if
har
proper
,
would
make
him
a
forc
to
be
reckon
with
on
the
footbal
field
.
you
can
figur
out
the
rest
from
here
.
Sandler
join
the
team
and
this
onc
lowli
waterboy
becom
a
footbal
star
.
As
I
said
,
the
film
had
a
great
deal
of
potenti
.
The
idea
was
a
decent
one
,
but
the
main
potenti
of
this
movi
is
a
result
of
the
cast
.
All
of
whom
are
veri
good
,
just
hamstrung
by
realli
,
realli
,
lousi
materi
.
Even
Sandler
,
annoy
goofi
voic
and
all
,
has
enough
charisma
and
natur
comed
abil
to
overcom
some
of
his
bad
materi
.
Even
as
unfunni
as
his
charact
is
,
I
still
found
myself
root
for
him
throughout
the
film
.
But
it
is
the
support
cast
that
I
feel
most
bad
about
.
If
their
materi
had
been
just
a
bit
better
,
this
film
could
have
been
such
a
funni
movi
.
Fairuza
Balk
play
Sandler
's
leather-wear
biker-chick
love
interest
and
doe
a
great
job
play
sleazi
and
sexi
at
the
same
time
.
Winkler
is
great
as
the
coach
who
use
a
``
Coach
For
Dummi
''
-
style
book
to
help
him
get
through
game
.
The
real
standout
though
,
is
Kathi
Bate
.
Even
with
some
of
the
worst
materi
of
her
career
to
deal
with
,
she
is
still
a
treat
to
watch
in
her
role
as
Sandler
's
overprotect
and
overbear
Mama
.
Even
with
the
perform
of
Bate
and
Winkler
,
there
is
absolut
no
way
I
would
recommend
this
movi
.
Although
I
get
the
distinct
impress
that
without
them
,
this
film
would
have
rank
in
negat
number
for
me
.
Which
is
sad
,
becaus
I
ca
n't
realli
put
my
finger
on
a
particular
element
of
the
movi
and
singl
it
out
as
the
caus
of
the
disast
that
it
becam
.
It
's
obvious
that
those
involv
,
specif
the
actor
,
tri
veri
hard
to
make
what
they
thought
was
go
to
be
a
funni
movi
.
It
's
just
too
bad
that
99
percent
of
all
of
the
joke
fell
flat
.
