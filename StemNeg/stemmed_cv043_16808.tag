``
Parti
Camp
,
''
is
one
of
the
most
mindnumb
brainless
comedi
I
ve
seen
in
awhil
.
A
late
rip-off
of
the
``
Meatbal
''
seri
,
the
film
follow
a
group
of
young
camp
counselor
at
Camp
Chipmunk
.
That
's
realli
about
all
that
can
be
said
about
the
``
plot
''
becaus
noth
much
happen
,
except
that
the
main
charact
,
wise-crack
Jerri
-LRB-
Andrew
Ross
-RRB-
,
has
the
hot
for
a
cute
blond
-LRB-
Kerri
Brennan
-RRB-
,
and
there
is
a
big
contest
in
the
climax
.
How
fun
!
Sinc
,
``
Parti
Camp
,
''
has
practic
no
screenplay
and
there
is
no
talent
at
all
involv
,
the
least
the
maker
could
have
done
was
make
it
raunchi
and
exploit
.
It
's
not
that
I
think
exploit
is
necessarili
a
good
qualiti
,
but
when
you
are
talk
about
a
dull
turkey
like
this
,
the
least
that
could
have
been
done
would
be
to
fill
it
with
a
lot
of
mindless
sex
.
Even
a
psychopath
slasher
at
the
camp
would
have
done
the
trick
.
At
least
,
then
,
it
would
n't
have
been
such
a
chore
to
sit
through
.
Never
befor
have
I
seen
so
mani
joke
fall
astound
flat
.
The
comedi
was
easi
to
spot
,
but
it
was
n't
the
least
bit
funni
.
It
was
groan-induc
.
Constant
throghout
,
I
was
ask
myself
if
director
Gari
Graver
actual
thought
this
movi
was
worth
anyth
.
So
what
save
,
``
Parti
Camp
,
''
from
the
dread
zero
star
rate
?
Well
,
that
's
simpl
:
Jewel
Shepard
,
as
a
flighti
bimbo
,
was
admit
fun
to
watch
.
Although
noth
could
have
save
this
film
from
the
lowest
depth
of
motion
pictur
trash
,
at
least
if
the
film
had
center
on
Shepard
,
she
might
have
been
abl
to
add
a
littl
spice
to
an
otherwis
rancid
,
low-budget
teen
comedy.-Copyright
