At
one
point
in
this
movi
there
is
a
stage
of
an
Opera
that
goe
complet
wrong
.
But
one
member
of
the
crowd
stand
up
and
cheer
,
think
the
perform
was
plan
,
and
applaud
it
for
their
effort
.
That
's
``
Dirti
Work
''
in
a
nutshel
.
A
veri
differ
kind
of
movi
.
This
is
not
a
movi
that
I
can
easili
review
.
The
critic
in
me
analyz
the
structur
,
plot
,
act
,
charact
...
and
tell
me
this
movi
is
terribl
.
But
the
Norm
MacDonald
fan
in
me
had
me
roll
on
the
floor
laugh
.
This
movi
play
more
like
an
HBO
sketch
comedi
than
a
movi
.
It
's
a
one
note
concept
.
Mitch
and
Sam
need
$
50000
in
order
to
bribe
a
doctor
to
give
their
father
a
heart
transplant
befor
other
more
needi
patient
.
Realiz
they
are
veri
good
at
reveng
plot
,
they
open
a
reveng
for
hire
busi
,
eventu
run
afoul
of
a
rich
businessman
play
by
Christoph
MacDonald
-LRB-
who
after
role
in
``
Happi
Gilmor
''
and
``
Veronica
's
Closet
''
seem
typcast
in
this
role
-RRB-
,
who
send
them
to
destroy
a
build
that
Mitch
learn
is
the
home
of
his
girlfriend
's
grandmoth
,
thus
lead
them
to
plot
against
the
rich
businessman
on
the
night
of
the
grand
open
of
a
new
Opera
hous
.
First
the
critic
in
me
.
The
plot
is
the
standard
poor
guy
vs
evil
rich
guy
devic
,
where
the
main
charact
meet
the
girl
of
his
dream
along
the
way
.
Here
's
the
catch
.
None
of
the
charact
are
sympathet
.
They
re
all
selfish
jerk
who
do
n't
care
who
they
hurt
in
their
attempt
to
do
whatev
they
want
.
The
joke
are
juvenil
,
crude
,
appeal
to
the
worst
element
in
peopl
.
There
's
joke
about
prostitut
,
the
homeless
,
beastial
,
anal
sex
.
There
's
even
a
subplot
that
's
develop
,
it
seem
,
onli
to
make
joke
about
infidel
and
incest
.
And
I
love
watch
it
.
I
was
a
huge
fan
of
Norm
MacDonald
's
sarcast
,
to-the-point
comedi
on
Saturday
Night
Live
,
and
this
movi
is
an
hour
and
a
half
of
it
.
Norm
MacDonald
take
a
joke
,
strip
it
to
the
core
,
and
tell
it
like
it
is
with
a
dri
wit
.
Like
the
scene
were
he
and
his
friend
are
learn
the
rope
at
a
new
construct
job
.
The
foreman
goe
over
the
basic
,
which
Mitch
and
Sam
do
n't
understand
.
How
do
they
get
out
of
it
?
By
admit
they
lie
on
their
resum
,
and
do
n't
know
a
thing
about
construct
!
And
surpris
,
they
get
fire
.
The
charact
are
incred
mean-spirit
.
There
's
a
father
who
's
loud
and
obnoxi
,
a
gambl
addict
Doctor
play
by
Chevi
Chase
who
tell
Sam
of
his
father
's
condit
by
say
``
If
I
were
a
gambl
man
I
'd
put
a
lot
of
money
on
death
.
''
The
businessman
Cole
who
alway
has
his
dog
Spunki
,
and
doe
who
know
what
with
it
.
And
then
there
's
Mitch
and
Sam
,
who
,
think
they
can
get
$
50000
by
destroy
a
build
,
ponder
how
their
action
would
ruin
the
live
of
the
resid
.
``
Too
bad
we
have
to
do
it
,
''
Mitch
say
.
Here
's
a
movi
where
everi
joke
that
is
execut
as
it
is
set
up
,
where
you
see
everi
punchlin
come
,
where
everi
spot
profan
could
be
use
and
then
is
use
.
At
least
the
film
is
honest
,
and
make
no
mistak
that
it
is
anyth
more
than
idiot
.
But
at
least
it
is
n't
dull
,
and
it
is
n't
predict
.
And
that
's
the
way
it
should
be
.
It
's
sketch
comedi
,
and
if
you
re
a
fan
of
Norm
MacDonald
,
you
ll
love
it
.
The
joke
are
crude
,
the
charact
are
mean
to
the
core
,
the
attitud
of
the
movi
is
that
it
just
doe
n't
care
.
If
you
do
n't
like
Norm
MacDonald
,
or
stupid
movi
,
then
you
probabl
wo
n't
like
this
one
.
The
joke
are
crude

the
charact

mean
to
the
core
,
the
attitud
of
the
movi
is
that
it
just
doe
n't
care

So
befor
see
this
one
,
tune
your
mindset
,
and
prepar
for
a
slew
of
Norm
MacDonald
humor
,
gay
anim
sex
,
prison
rape
joke
,
uncar
charact
,
and
one
last
perform
from
Chris
Farley
.
I
just
could
n't
stop
laugh
.
