The
origin
_
Babe
_
was
my
favorit
movi
of
1995
,
a
sleeper
hit
that
transcend
it
target
audienc
.
Be
a
surpris
commerci
and
critic
success
,
it
had
no
market
tie-in
,
which
limit
it
final
take
.
Thus
,
Babearr
,
with
a
budget
greater
than
the
money
made
in
Babe
1
.
Plush
doll
,
vend
machin
hawk
t-shirt
,
and
Maci
's
Thanksgiv
Day
Balloon
arriv
for
holiday
money-grub
.
This
is
a
sad
review
to
write
,
becaus
Babenot
onli
doe
_
not
_
live
up
to
the
origin
,
but
it
doe
n't
even
come
to
a
fraction
of
it
.
I
should
n't
expect
that
sequel
to
modern
fairi
tale
to
match
their
predecessor
'
magic
,
but
this
film
tri
too
hard
,
and
lose
it
charm
.
Consid
a
driver
appli
the
acceler
with
great
intens
,
unawar
that
his
car
is
in
neutral
.
Imagin
with
me
,
if
you
will
,
_
Scream
_
's
Jami
Kennedi
,
explain
the
``
rule
''
for
sequel
like
Babe
2

Keep
the
stori
card
to
break
up
the
action
:
that
's
cute
too
,
even
though
``
The
Pig
Get
Wise

made
no

given
the
context
of

There
must
be
action

howev
illog

that
will
conjur
up

the
origin

the
trademark
song
that

the

the
``

Season
now
with
the
``
origin
''
element
,
which
,
as
we
will
find
out
,
are
straight
from
the
screenwriting-is-hel

-RRB-
Chang
the

This
has

Excuse

:
did
n't

Side
note
:
to
give
the
citi
a
fairy-tal
look
,
Georg
Miller
craft
a
fantast
fantasyland
that
merg
the
landmark
of
the
world
's
great
citi
,
and
yes
,
it
_
is
_
impress
.
But
this
too
is
over-us
,
repeat
the
same
view
over
and
again
on

And
,
for

Given
the
limit
of
Cromwel
,
the
human
element
is
taken
over
by
``
the
boss
'
wife
''
play
by
Magda
Szubanski
.
S-t-r-e-t-c-h
.
She
's
not
a
lead
actress-typ
,
she
's
not
funni
enough
in
her
physic
comedi
,
and
she
's
simpli
embarrass
in
some
of
her
pratfal
.
-LRB-
Have
her
arrest
fals
on
drug
charg
!
Have
her
accident
incit
a
riot
with
biker
dude
and
scantili
clad
babe
!
Have
her
bounc
around
on
a
bunge
cord
at
a

benefit

!
-RRB-
I
was
hope
for
a
littl
smirk
dure
these
scene
,
but
I
felt
sorri
for
the
embarrass
that
she
put
herself
in
.
I
am
restrain
myself
from
talk
about
the
dark
natur
of
the
film
,
the
violenc
,
the
scene
where
a
pit
bull
dangl
from
the
bridg
,
head
submerg
underwat
.
Even
the
best
fairi
tale
have
a
bit
of
the
macabr
in
it
,
as
the
Brother
Grimm
have
demonstr
.
No
...
my
problem
is
with
the
stori
,
or
lack
thereof
.
_
Babe
_
is
sent
out
to
save
the
Hoggett
farm
,
but
onc
in
the
citi
,
that
stori
is
forgotten
.
Be
a
good-natur
pig
in
the
midst
of
the
cynic
of
his
environ
is
nice
,
but
,
other
than
rescu
that
aforement
pit
bull
,
what
did
Babe
actual
_
do
_
?
Without
give
the
end
away
,
the
farm
is
save
from
a
left-field
quirk
that
had
noth
to
do
with
the
pig
.
Speak
of
``
pig
''
,
or
,
``
pig-pig-pig-pig-pig
!
''
.
The
word
``
pig
''
is
so
overus
,
had
they
chang
it
to
an
explet
,
and
had
the
pig
be
Al
Pacino
,
I
could
have
been
watch
_
Scarfac
_
.
This
is
screenwrit
?
Further
,
I
can
not
explain
the
deep
gnaw
at
my
gut
in
the
mani
scene
where
accid
happen
to
good
peopl
in
fantast
elabor
setup
.
Had
it
been
a
cartoon
,
and
the
victim
be
an
equival
of
Elmer
Fudd
,
mayb
my
reaction
would
have
been
soften
.
But
to
Farmer
Hoggett
?
His
wife
?
An
elder
Mickey
Rooney
?
Much
too
irrever
.
-LRB-
``
Quick
!
''
Splice
those
sing
mice
into
those
scene
!

-RRB-

''
The
film
is
n't
a
coloss
failur
.
I
did
like
Glenn
Headley
's
schmoozi
chimpanze
.
I
like
the
pink
poodl
.
The
dog
on
the
cart
,
who
momentarili
think
he
's
in
dog
heaven
.
And
a
weird
look
guy
who
may
have
been
doubly-cast
as
an
airport
employe
and
a
judg
.
But
most
of
the
time
,
I
was
look
down
,
in
boredom
,
or
in
embarrass
over
the
hacked-up
script
.
Them
sing
mice
,
those
chapter
partit
,
the
profici
act
of
the
anim
--
none
of
these
can
compens
for
a
stori
.
Let
me
spoil
the
final
scene
:
Farmer
Hoggett
look
at
pig
,
proud
,
say
``
That
ll
do
,
pig
.
''
That
ll
do
.
''
''
That
's
it
.
Hope
I
did
n't
ruin
it
for
you
.
But
tell
me
this
:
what
the
heck
did
that
pig
_
DO
_
?
