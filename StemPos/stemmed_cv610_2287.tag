One
year
has
pass
sinc
the
last
time
we
saw
them
,
and
but
Wayn
Campbel
and
Garth
Algar
are
back
but
,
they
ve
move
out
of
their
parent
home
,
and
now
have
their
own
pad
in
an
abandon
warehous
.
Wayn
's
still
hopeless
infatu
with
his
girlfriend
,
Cassandra
,
and
of
cours
Garth
is
still
have
his
own
,
person
grow
pain
.
They
guy
are
just
finish
off
one
of
their
show
,
and
head
off
to
an
Aerosmith
concert
where
they
run
across
Cassandra
and
her
new
manag
,
a
stereotyp
industri
slime
not
unlik
the
charact
Rob
Low
portray
in
the
previous
film
.
Again
,
the
promot
is
not
onli
after
the
money
that
Cassandra
's
talent
can
bring
in
.
The
storylin
quick
degrad
to
a
parallel
of
the
origin
,
``
guy
lose
chick
,
guy
realiz
mistak
,
and
guy
get
chick
back
.
''
Fortun
,
there
is
more
to
this
movi
than
this
somewhat
sheer
plot
.
The
wit
and
humor
in
this
film
are
surpris
intellig
and
fresh
with
mani
insid
joke
on
the
film
and
music
industri
as
well
as
just
a
lot
of
hilari
scene
of
Wayn
and
Garth
show
their
true
color
.
Highlight
of
the
movi
includ
a
spoof
of
JURASSIC
PARK
,
Garth
's
seduct
by
a
marri
woman
,
a
surpris
appear
by
Charleton
Heston
,
a
1960
's
Batman
setup
in
the
guy
's
pad
,
and
some
pretti
groovi
chat
with
Jim
Morrison
and
some
``
nake
Indian
guy
,
''
an
unexpect
lip-sync
of
yMCA
-LRB-
you
could
see
that
one
come
a
mile
away
-RRB-
and
of
cours
a
hilari
parodi
of
those
badly-dub
kung-fu
movi
we
love
to
laugh
at
.
And
if
you
ve
ever
wonder
whi
there
's
alway
box
of
watermelon
,
chicken
,
and
peopl
walk
plate
glass
in
the
middl
of
street
,
you
ll
find
out
here
.
This
movi
also
explor
Wayn
and
Garth
a
littl
more
.
Garth
has
somewhat
of
a
``
come
of
age
''
and
Wayn
get
to
learn
a
littl
about
himself
-LRB-
with
a
littl
help
from
our
old
friend
,
Jim
Morrison
-RRB-
.
A
few
old
joke
from
the
previous
movi
are
explor
here
again
,
but
this
time
with
a
few
twist
to
keep
them
fresh
,
and
luckili
,
few
,
if
ani
of
them
are
overus
.
Overal
,
the
movi
has
plenti
of
continu
flaw
-LRB-
especi
in
the
fight
scent
between
Garth
and
Cassandra
's
dad
-RRB-
,
but
these
are
easili
overlook
as
this
is
,
after
Wayn
's
World
.
The
plot
is
flimsi
but
manag
.
There
are
a
few
special
effect
,
but
they
are
fair
seamless
,
and
fill
nice
into
the
plot
.
The
act
is
good
,
for
this
sort
of
movi
,
but
there
are
some
veri
bright
spot
.
In
the
big
pictur
,
this
movi
is
just
plain
fun
.
There
is
lot
of
intellig
humor
that
make
this
film
special
.
Dure
the
whole
one
hour
andminut
,
I
did
n't
even
think
about
look
at
my
watch
a
singl
time
.
Silli
,
but
riotous
at
time
,
this
is
an
excel
movi
even
better
than
the
origin
.
