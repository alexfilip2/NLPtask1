A
bleak
indi
film
about
a
stolen
ident
.
There
's
not
much
more
to
this
visual
stylish
film
than
what
meet
the
eye
,
as
it
reli
on
shock
to
tell
it
stori
of
a
prolong
vicious
mug
.
It
fall
into
the
categori
of
be
a
pretenti
art-hous
film
,
leav
a
bitter
tast
in
one
's
mouth
as
it
stereotyp
it
charact
and
unintent
further
inflam
the
racial
issu
.
It
tri
to
make
a
heavy-hand
point
about
disenfranchis
black
youth
trap
by
their
environ
,
with
their
onli
way
out
be
crime
.
But
the
stori
is
so
fill
with
violenc
and
it
NyC
set
look
like
hell
,
that
it
's
hard
to
enjoy
this
film
and
to
follow
what
the
logic
in
the
stori
is
suppos
to
mean
.
The
relationship
between
the
black
mugger
and
his
white
victim
is
a
cloudi
one
,
which
the
film
never
determin
what
it
want
to
say
about
it
.
Matt
Mahurin
is
virtual
one-man
crew
in
put
this
film
togeth
-LRB-
director/writ
/
cinematographer/editor
-RRB-
,
who
is
a
still
photograph
in
his
day
job
.
The
film
work
best
as
a
visual
challeng
piec
,
as
each
shot
look
like
a
photograph
care
tell
the
stori
unfold
.
A
white
photograph
-LRB-
Robert
Knepper
-RRB-
is
mug
by
a
black
gang
while
he
's
on
a
freelanc
assign
to
take
a
photo
shoot
of
Harlem
at
night
.
He
becom
a
victim
of
amnesia
and
his
head
is
bloodi
as
he
's
left
in
a
desert
Harlem
build
,
as
the
gang
leav
him
for
dead
;
but
,
one
of
the
mugger
,
Rumor
-LRB-
Michael
William
-RRB-
,
come
back
and
pretend
to
help
him
.
He
's
a
would-b
photograph
,
who
keep
a
scrapbook
entitl
MugShot
in
the
project
apart
he
share
with
his
mother
and
younger
brother
.
Keep
his
victim
in
the
dark
about
who
he
is
by
call
him
Joe
and
not
tell
him
what
's
happen
,
he
becom
the
photograph
for
a
few
day
.
He
enter
the
photograph
's
stylish
Greenwich
Villag
apart
and
steal
his
expens
camera
,
and
decid
to
hold
the
mug
vic
for
ransom
when
he
find
out
he
has
a
black
girlfriend
,
Stella
-LRB-
Belinda
Becker
-RRB-
.
She
's
the
onli
one
in
the
film
who
could
act
.
The
film
is
stuck
with
a
clumsi
dialogu
and
an
overus
of
symbol
,
as
it
end
with
noth
more
to
tell
after
the
shock
and
the
violent
situat
it
creat
except
to
beat
it
into
the
ground
.
It
could
onli
be
commend
for
how
appeal
the
film
look
,
as
if
it
's
a
scrapbook
of
still
photo
put
togeth
to
celebr
a
mug
.
