After
the
huge
success
of
``
The
Exorcist
''
in
1973
a
sequel
was
inevit
,
and
sad
like
most
horror
fim
that
make
money
,
the
filmmak
decid
to
make
a
ridicul
sequel
,
that
make
absolut
no
sens
at
all
,
and
to
me
was
extrem
pointless
,
wast
Linda
Blair
and
Max
von
Sydow
complet
.
Needless
,
dumb
sequel
flop
in
the
box
offic
,
and
never
gain
much
success
though
it
is
vote
as
one
of
the
worst
sequel
of
all
time
,
to
which
I
agre
with
.
To
start
the
``
stori
''
it
is
four
year
later
,
and
Regan
is
be
torment
by
memori
of
what
use
to
be
,
now
a
priest
play
by
Richard
Burton
,
is
tri
to
figur
out
whi
this
demon
tri
to
possess
Regan
,
and
now
the
demon
somehow
want
to
possess
her
again
-LRB-
mayb
she
was
good
or
someth
-RRB-
.
Now
they
must
tri
to
stop
this
demon
from
take
over
Regan
's
bodi
,
befor
it
is
too
late
.
Some
of
the
bad
thing
Exorcist
II
has
in
it
is
:
Linda
Blair
,
she
had
no
need
to
reviv
her
charact
,
and
she
is
realli
terribl
in
this
film
,
she
bring
it
down
to
a
lull
,
and
in
place
it
seem
like
it
just
stop
in
it
place
,
and
doe
n't
go
anywher
.
Louis
Fletcher
is
alright
for
what
it
's
worth
,
but
she
could
have
done
a
lot
better
than
this
.
The
direct
by
John
Boorman
,
is
that
of
a
confus
,
stylish
natur
that
I
realli
could
n't
figur
out
.
In
fact
,
I
had
no
idea
what
was
go
on
in
this
film
,
the
script
was
jumbl
,
the
plot
was
jumbl
,
and
the
end
is
just
laugh
out
loud
hilariosli
bad
.
For
those
Exorcist
fan
who
have
n't
seen
this
one
,
I
recommend
rent
it
.
I
actual
gave
this
one
a
high
rate
,
if
it
were
ani
wors
it
would
have
deserv
Zero
Pumpkin
,
I
went
easi
on
it
howev
becaus
of
the
fact
that
it
has
a
bit
of
good
direct
,
but
noth
els
!
Im
not
say
I
like
the
film
now
,
so
dont
start
go
anywher
.
Bad
,
Bad
,
Bad
Movi
.
