There
have
been
bad
film
in
recent
year
:
'
Mr.
Magoo
'
was
by
far
the
worst
ever
made
,
the
spectacular
bad
'
Blue
In
The
Face
'
,
the
horribl
'
Babi
Genuis
'
and
now
'
I
Woke
Up
Ear
The
Day
I
Die
'
.
It
may
not
howev
be
the
worst
movi
made
but
it
certain
rank
as
one
bad
movi
.
The
film
's
act
-LRB-
if
that
's
what
you
want
to
call
it
-RRB-
is
well
mediocr
to
me
.
Load
with
a
sensat
cast
you
would
think
that
the
cast
would
at
least
save
the
film
a
bit
,
boy
was
I
wrong
.
After
escap
from
a
mental
institut
'
The
Thief
'
play
by
Billi
Zane
goe
out
in
the
real
world
and
find
that
it
is
pretti
harsh
and
gritti
.
He
turn
to
burglari
to
surviv
,
rob
a
loan
back
,
kill
the
loan
offic
and
run
with
thousand
.
A
country-wid
man
hunt
is
on
for
him
to
catch
him
and
bring
him
down
.
He
end
up
in
a
cemeteri
where
he
put
his
money
in
a
coffin
to
keep
it
for
later
,
come
back
and
realiz
that
someon
took
it
and
put
it
somewher
.
Now
he
is
determin
to
kill
all
the
visitor
at
the
funer
earlier
that
day
until
he
get
his
money
back
,
ultim
lead
to
a
final
that
is
less
that
satisfi
.
A
film
which
was
base
on
a
'
long-lost
'
script
by
Ed
Wood
,
I
have
onli
one
question
:
No
dialogu
,
onli
music
and
movement
where
exact
is
the
point
?
The
film
move
along
at
a
rather
slow
pace
,
but
doe
have
one
advantag
:
the
soundtrack
which
is
catchi
and
vibrant
except
the
first
song
which
can
be
offens
to
some
.
It
open
with
a
fun
,
innov
open
credit
sequenc
and
quick
goe
downhil
after
that
.
Some
of
the
low
point
are
when
'
The
Thief
'
steal
a
woman
's
purs
,
and
then
she
faint
,
Sandra
Bernhard
as
a
dancer
and
Tippi
Hendren
as
a
deaf
woman
whom
'
The
Thief
'
kill
to
the
music
of
'
Psycho
'
.
Come
on
peopl
get
some
new
idea
alreadi
!
What
's
even
wors
is
that
the
film
has
no
plot
at
all
.
Well
to
a
certain
extent
it
doe
,
but
who
care
by
the
time
the
middl
of
the
film
arriv
we
re
bore
out
of
our
mind
and
readi
for
someth
fun
and
excit
to
happen
.
'
I
Woke
Up
Ear
The
Day
I
Die
'
is
a
perfect
bad
film
.
It
show
us
how
low
filmmak
get
sometim
just
when
desper
to
make
a
movi
.
Even
with
the
huge
cast
talent
,
the
film
is
a
wast
of
my
time
and
certain
a
wast
of
your
.
