He

potenti
he
has

fulfil
--
yet
,
he
has

so
much
for

.
As
a
young
chap
,
his
ambit
was
to
leav
his
hometown
of
Bedford
Fall
.
But
time
and
ambit
chang

a
marvel
.
Frank
Capra
's
film
is
a
centeni
classic
--
watch
and
re-experienc
by
everi
generat
.
Wonder
Life
is
one
of
the
few
pictur
of
time
gone
by
that
seem
as
fresh
,
mayb
fresher
,
then
it
did
when
it
was
first
releas
.
Mani
film
of
the
thirti
through
seventi
have
age
poor
.
But
this
one
is
a
near
flawless
exampl
of
how
well
a
perfect
script
and
time
can
mesh
with
first-rat
act
,
wit
and
suspens
,
glorious
music
,
and
terrif
set
peic
.
The
onli
even
slight
date
scene
are
those
at
the
begin
in
which
God
has
a
long
chat
with
Clarenc
,
Georg
's
guardian
angel
.
They
are
n't
all
that
bad
,
but
they
remain
corni
and
a
littl
out
of
place
.
Nevertheless
,
this
is
one
film
that
deserv
it
place
in
time
,
cinema
histori
,
and
our
heart
.
It
can
be
equal
appreci
by
anyon
of
ani
age
.
Here
is
one
genuin
masterpeic
,
a
classic
that
reach
height
and
ambit
near
perfect
.
This
crackl
good
mixtur
result
in
a
film
which
is
at
onc
funni
,
excit
,
move
and
uplift
.
The
film
itself
is
almost
a
revers
of
the
life
of
Georg
Bailey
--
there
is
n't
too
much
to
it
,
but
Capra
and
the
gang
-LRB-
various
screenwrit
,
compos
,
actor
-RRB-
plumet
the
materi
to
it
fullest
potenti
.
The
result
is
a
film
--
though
not
at
first
intend
to
be
pigeon-hol
as
a
holiday
film
--
that
will
alway
be
rememb
,
celebr
,
and
love
.
