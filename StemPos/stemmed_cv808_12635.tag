Did
Claus
Von
Bulow
tri
to
kill
his
wife
Sunni
in
their
Newport
mansion
?
That
is
the
question
Revers
of
Fortun
ask
you
to
consid
as
it
open
in
a
hospit
ward
,
with
a
comatos
Sunni
Von
Bulow
.
She
is
the
main
narrat
of
the
film
,
in
a
narrat
trick
that
was
extraordinarili
riski
for
Schroeder
.
The
dramat
trick
work
,
as
Sunni
Von
Bulow
narrat
a
compel
stori
of
murder
,
sex
,
unhappi
,
and
a
lawyer
's
moral
dilemma
as
he
take
a
case
he
think
he
can
not
win
.
Jeremi
Iron
is
Claus
Von
Bulow
,
in
what
is
his
finest
role
,
and
one
of
the
most
devast
evil
perform
in
histori
.
He
is
as
hate
as
ani
man
aliv
,
as
cold
as
a
cucumb
.
His
remors
for
his
wife
's
comatos
condit
is
nonexist
,
and
it
is
no
wonder
that
even
his
children
have
difficulti
accept
his
version
of
what
happen
dure
Christma
,
1980
.
The
background
to
the
case
is
such
.
Dure
Christma
of
1979
,
Sunni
Von
Bulow
fell
into
a
deep
coma
from
which
she
recov
and
awok
.
The
same
situat
occur
in
1980
,
onli
Sunni
never
woke
,
and
probabl
never
will
.
When
examin
,
it
was
found
that
she
had
14
time
the
normal
amount
of
insulin
within
her
blood
.
Claus
Von
Bulow
is
then
accus
of
attempt
murder
by
his
stepson
,
convict
,
and
freed
on
bail
.
He
immedi
hire
Alan
Dershowitz
,
the
renow
Harvard
Law
professor
,
to
acquit
him
.
Ron
Silver
is
magnific
as
a
moral
lawyer
who
can
not
stand
what
has
happen
to
him
.
We
follow
him
through
two
veri
differ
case
;
the
case
of
the
Johnson
case
,
where
two
innoc
kid
are
stand
on
Death
Row
for
a
crime
they
did
n't
commit
,
and
von
Bulow
,
who
he
still
has
n't
figur
out
.
Dershowitz
doe
n't
know
what
happen
to
Sunni
,
and
he
is
extrem
hesit
to
take
the
case
.
Nevertheless
,
he
doe
,
base
on
certain
thing
which
happen
dure
the
investig
process
that
deepli
upset
him
.
Togeth
with
a
group
of
law
student
,
Dershowitz
concoct
a
defens
and
ultim
get
the
verdict
revers
.
Silver
's
perform
is
one
of
a
hand
of
solid
role
in
this
deep
film
.
Schroeder
direct
on
mani
differ
level
,
with
multipl
plot
line
which
blend
in
wonder
in
the
mind
of
Alan
Dershowitz
.
There
are
flaw
;
at
time
,
the
film
get
over
theatric
.
yet
,
due
to
Glenn
Close
's
troubl
and
brutal
honest
perform
as
Sunni
von
Bulow
,
the
use
of
her
comatos
bodi
as
a
narrat
work
here
fair
well
.
The
flashback
are
good
,
but
at
time
Schroeder
doe
n't
fill
in
the
blank
.
The
movi
could
have
benefit
with
the
increas
attent
of
certain
develop
dure
the
film
,
and
it
could
have
use
a
better
end
.
The
film
progress
wonder
befor
end
sudden
,
without
ani
intellig
conclus
.
The
support
charact
are
often
neglect
,
and
Dershowitz
's
team
should
have
been
allow
to
grow
charact
wise
,
but
Schroeder
over-simplifi
the
stori
and
the
charact
.
yet
,
for
all
these
flaw
,
the
film
is
deepli
engross
becaus
of
Iron
.
As
von
Bulow
,
he
is
brutal
evil
.
Anti-Semit
,
prejud
,
arrog
,
protect
,
he
is
a
rotten
,
lie
monster
,
whose
convict
may
have
been
wrong
legal
,
but
moral
he
was
to
blame
.
Iron
play
him
to
a
cold
perfect
,
with
pathet
attempt
to
gain
moral
support
for
his
claim
to
innoc
.
He
is
an
adulter
liar
and
a
cheat
who
in
all
likelihood
commit
the
murder
.
Howev
,
the
genius
of
Revers
of
Fortun
come
in
it
distinct
between
moral
culpabl
and
legal
respons
.
There
is
no
doubt
von
Bulow
is
respons
for
his
wife
's
death
by
year
of
neglect
and
cold
.
Howev
,
legal
,
did
he
do
the
murder
?
Schroeder
dare
the
viewer
to
make
up
his
own
mind
.
With
all
the
charact
flaw
,
Revers
of
Fortun
is
an
engross
puzzl
becaus
it
is
intellig
;
he
want
the
viewer
to
make
up
his
own
mind
.
Schroeder
taunt
the
viewer
with
contradictori
revel
,
and
then
mention
that
the
answer
to
this
compel
puzzl
shall
be
reveal
when
we
join
Sunni
von
Bulow
,
in
death
.
For
all
the
fail
dramat
theatric
,
this
is
one
that
work
beauti
.
We
do
n't
know
what
happen
.
That
sens
of
legal
ambigu
,
along
with
von
Bulow
's
obvious
moral
guilt
,
is
whi
Reversalf
Fortun
work
.
In
the
end
,
von
Bulow
is
as
sadist
as
ever
.
Iron
is
haunt
,
and
that
is
whi
Revers
of
Fortun
is
so
good
.
