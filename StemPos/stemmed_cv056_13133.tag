The
Disney
studio
has
it
formula
for
annual
,
full-length
anim
featur
down
so
pat
that
it
's
hard
to
rememb
which
one
you
re
watch
at
ani
given
moment
.
``
Mulan
,
''
their
36th
anim
adventur
,
is
the
latest
case
in
point
.
Once
again
we
have
a
tale
focus
around
a
strong
central
charact
-LRB-
femal
as
usual
;
Disney
is
one
of
the
few
studio
whose
heroin
--
Ariel
,
Bell
,
Pocahonta
,
and
now
Mulan
--
get
equal
screen
time
with
their
hero
in
recent
year
-RRB-
.
Add
the
requisit
love
interest
and
a
wise-crack
sidekick
or
two
,
pep
up
the
soundtrack
with
a
hand
of
strateg
place
show
tune
-LRB-
an
introspect
number
by
a
pool
or
look
in
a
mirror
,
a
rous
anthem
,
a
cutesi
,
montage-back
crowd
pleaser
-RRB-
,
pose
a
few
threat
to
our
engag
lead
,
and
tie
thing
all
up
neat
by
the
close
credit
.

Mayb
an

without

shock

Or
mayb
a
film
in
which
a
cheeki
Chihuahua

How
about

It
is

gon
na
happen
.
Like
Disney
's
previous
entri
,
``
Mulan
''
is
slow
to
make
it
mark
.
The
anim
tend
to
suffer
from
some
slack
in
the
earli
go
and
the
humor
element
,
a
madcap
dragon
wannab
-LRB-
in
the
guis
of
a
loquaci
lizard
with
a
case
of
dri
mouth

Highlight
includ
a
spectacular

which
,
due
to
the
sophist
of
today

is
hard
to

and
last
but
not

,
Mulan
herself
.
Voic
by
Ming-Na
Wen
,
Mulan
is
Disney
's
strongest
femal
charact
to
date
.
When

of

the

the

Mulan

She

90s
a
coupl

Formula

``
