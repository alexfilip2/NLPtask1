Carol
see
that

self-assured
.
She
is
invigor
by
his
command
presenc

This
,
of

doe
more
to

Newman
and
Fiorentino
than
it
doe

Newman
is
the

Fiorentino
is
also
a
fun
presenc

you
root
for
her
despit
her
sens
of
amor
.
Sure
,
she
want
to
commit
robberi
and
has
littl
compunct
about

,
but
we
can
see
that

With
