``
There
will
be
anoth

''
the
ad
for
this
sequel
proclaim
,
and
whi
not
?
True
,
Brandon
Lee
is
dead
,
but
there
would
be
no
reason
for
him
to
appear
in
a
followup
to
1994
's
The
Crow
,
anyway
.
The
idea
of
spin
artist
Jame
O'Barr
's
origin
comic
book
seri
into
a
sequel
franchis
revolv
around
the
notion
that
a
differ
startl
soul
would
come
back
from
the
dead
in
each
movi
,
take
it
own
righteous
vengeanc
against
the
world
.
Given
that
basic
framework
,
the
stori
could
move
in
ani
number
of
direct
.
Of
cours
,
it
doe
n't
.
Stubborn
,
The
Crow
:
Citi
of
Angel
backtrack
to
the
begin
of
the
previous
film
,
when
Lee
's
Eric
Draven
found
himself
drawn
back
out
of
his
grave
to
do
a
Charl
Bronson
on
the
thug
who
tortur
him
and
his
girlfriend
to
death
.
I
rememb
the
first
film
primarili
as
a
harrow
exercis
in
brutal
.
In
flashback
,
we
see
the
most
excruci
crime
exact
on
Eric
and
his
lover
,
and
then
we
watch
in
real-tim
as
Eric
pay
each
perpetr
back
in
kind
.
It
's
loud
and
repetit
,
true
,
a
sadist
's
delight
--
but
it
's
also
horrifi
and
fascin
.
Citi
of
Angel
give
us
more
of
the
same
,
but
less
skill
.
There
's
an
audienc
guarante
for
a
film
like
this
,
although
bad
review
and
poor
word-of-mouth
will
like
ensur
that
it
wo
n't
be
much
of
a
success
.
In
fact
,
Miramax
subsidiari
Dimens
Film
was
so
fear
of
the
critic
reaction
to
this
pictur
that
review
were
shut
out
of
advanc
screen
.
-LRB-
I
ve
never
understood
the
reason
behind
this
tactic
,
sinc
good
notic
have
never
been
key
to
the
success
of
movi
like
The
Crow
.
-RRB-
So
much
for
ani
confid
in
the
worthi
of
their
followup
.
This
time
,
Ashe
-LRB-
French-acc
actor
Vincent
Perez
-RRB-
is
retriev
from
his
wateri
death
-LRB-
he
and
his
young
son
were
shackl
togeth
,
shot
,
and
then
thrown
off
a
pier
-RRB-
by
the
crow
who
serv
as
his
link
between
the
world
of
the
live
and
the
dead
.
Perez
might
have
some
screen
presenc
if
he
's
given
someth
to
do
with
himself
,
but
here
he
's
simpli
thrown
in
front
of
the
camera
as
a
pretti
face
.
At
first
,
he
's
shiveri
and
frighten
,
but
he
quick
recov
from
the
shock
of
his
own
death
and
becom
a
badass
biker
from
beyond
the
grave
.
He
's
befriend
by
Sarah
-LRB-
Mia
Kirshner
-RRB-
,
presum
an
older
version
of
the
child
who
narrat
the
first
film
.
Kirshner
,
so
beguil
in
Exotica
,
is
here
an
exquisit
photograph
blank
.
Tattoo
with
angel
'
wing
,
Sarah
is
just
about
as
love
as
women
come
,
but
she
serv
no
purpos
,
not
even
as
seductress
.
The
gang
of
punk
who
kill
Ashe
are
ostens
command
by
Judah
-LRB-
Richard
Brook
-RRB-
,
but
a
far
more
interest
choic
as
leader
would
have
been
Iggi
Pop
,
who
play
a
gaunt
fellow
name
Curv
.
Iggi
,
all
bone
,
vein
,
and
drawl
,
is
the
onli
one
who
seem
to
have
share
in
the
aesthet
of
ruin
that
defin
this
film
.
Like
all
good
thing
here
,
he
's
dispatch
too
soon
and
without
much
imagin
.
In
the
meantim
,
we
re
subject
to
tedious
glimps
of
Judah
's
compound
,
where
bondag
is
the
order
of
the
day
and
hot
wax
is
pour
over
nake
bodi
in
S&M
fantasi
that
would
seem
shi
of
the
cut
edg
even
if
they
were
n't
distinct
secondhand
.
Even
the
soundtrack
is
tire
.
More
than
anyth
I
ve
seen
from
Hollywood
late
,
Citi
of
Angel
smack
bald
of
product
--
it
's
a
movi
with
a
lousi
script
but
a
great
look
.
Critic
have
been
quick
to
fault
the
direct
of
MTV
veteran
Tim
Pope
,
but
his
work
is
n't
that
bad
per
se
.
He
's
got
a
good
eye
,
and
some
intrigu
visual
idea
--
if
anyth
,
this
movi
has
a
few
too
mani
scene
of
ridicul
strike
imageri
.
His
major
stylist
fail
is
that
he
ca
n't
seem
to
direct
an
action
scene
,
and
the
quick
,
nonsens
cut
that
ensu
is
reminisc
of
a
low
budget
kung
fu
movi
.
But
as
director
,
he
must
also
shoulder
the
blame
for
the
littl
screenplay
that
was
n't
,
the
perform
who
could
n't
,
and
an
appar
lack
of
idea
on
the
part
of
everyon
involv
.
Who
bought
David
S.
Goyer
's
anem
script
,
anyway
?
The
produc
of
this
Crow
were
either
too
dim
to
realiz
their
stori
was
doom
to
be
a
hollow
rehash
,
or
too
cynic
to
figur
their
audienc
would
know
the
differ
.
