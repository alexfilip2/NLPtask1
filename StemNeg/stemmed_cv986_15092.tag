WRONGFULLi
ACCUSED
There
are
those
of
us
who
think
of
Lesli
Nielsen
as
the
bumbl
,
hapless
straight
man
from
the
hyster
``
Nake
Gun
''
film
,
crack
an
immedi
smile
and
forgiv
him
of
whatev
waver
movi
spoof
he
's
commit
himself
to
star
in
sinc
.
The
waver
movi
spoof
,
howev
,
are
less
forgiv
.
To
be
fair
,
``
Wrong
Accuse
,
''
the
send-up
in
question
and
Nielsen
's
third
parodi
sinc
the
last
``
Gun
,
''
is
n't
quit
as
excruci
humorless
as
his
``
Dracula
:
Dead
and
Love
It
''
or
``
Spi
Hard
,
''
which
is
a
mighti
good
thing
.
Nielsen
is
still
in
tip-top
comed
form
,
abl
as
ever
to
deadpan
his
way
through
even
the
most
horribl
pun
,
but
he
realli
need
a
screenplay
that
play
off
his
talent
instead
of
reli
on
them
,
and
he
need
one
veri
soon
.

There

``

get
off
to
an
assur
start
,
with
an
in-concert
Nielsen
,
tout
``
Lord
of
the
Violin
''
by
bare-chest
poster
,
pull
a
Jimi
Hendrix
on
his
music
instrument
as
hundr
of
tuxedo-clad
mosh
in
front
of
the
stage
.
Nice
touch
.
Most
of
the
scene
that
follow
,
howev
,
never
top
the
open
.
-LRB-
Hyster
except
:
the
Mento
and
``
Baywatch
''
goof
.
-RRB-
Movi
parodi
are
cram
in
at
an
almost-sublimin
rate
,
but
most
are
empti
.
When
a
giant
snake
lung
onto
the
screen
and
snatch
a
cast
member
a
la
``
Anaconda
''
or
basebal
player
disappear
into
a
``
Field
of
Dream
''
-
esqu
cornfield
,
there
's
realli
noth
to
laugh
at
.
Other
moment
,
like
an
interlud
in
a
fish
shop
,
are
so
unfocus
that
you
re
not
sure
what
you
re
suppos
to
be
laugh
at
.
There
seem
to
be
more
cheap
refer
than
frenzi
send-up
here
,
so
it
's
possibl
that
director/writ
Pat
Proft
,
by
bombard
the
viewer
with
a
careless
mixtur
of
the
two
,
guarante
someth
is
sure
to
stick
.
And
what
doe
stick
stick
well
,
particular
the
jab
at
genr
convent
like
styliz
flashback
and
hard-boil
dialogu
,
what
those
``
Nake
Gun
``
s
-LRB-
which
Proft
collabor
on
-RRB-
did
great
;
these
bit
are
so
on-target
that
they
allow
you
to
rememb
``
Wrong
Accuse
''
as
an
almost-halfway-ther
spoof
instead
of
a
lame-brain
failur
.
The
movi
might
have
been
curs
to
begin
with
,
open
fast
on
the
heel
of
``
Mafia
!
''
,
from
Proft
colleagu
Jim
Abraham
,
and
``
BASEketbal
,
''
from
Proft
colleagu
David
Zucker
,
but
it
's
a
strong
possibl
that
nobodi
is
go
to
be
accus
``
Wrong
Accuse
''
of
be
Nielsen
's
funniest
.
