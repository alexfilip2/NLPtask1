In
the
1982
updat
of
Mickey
Spillan
's
1947
novel
``
I
,
The
Juri
,
''
hard-boil
detect
Mike
Hammer
is
a
Vietnam
vet
who
drive
a
shini
bronz
Tran
Am
,
dress
like
Don
Johnson
in
``
Miami
Vice
''
with
less
pastel
,
and
has
sworn
off
alcohol
.
Howev
,
he
still
smoke
his
Lucki
Strike
,
detest
all
form
of
author
,
and
kill
at
a
whim
.
Beyond
that
,
the
updat
film
retain
littl
or
no
resembl
to
the
origin
pulpi
page-turn
by
Spillan
,
probabl
the
most
infam
and
often
revil
of
all
mysteri
writer
.
The
movi
start
off
with
a
bang
:
a
howler
of
an
open
credit
sequenc
that
is
a
cheap
steal
from
the
Jame
Bond
seri
,
complet
with
cheesi
graphic
and
an
overbear
jazz
score
by
Bill
Conti
-LRB-
``
Rocki
''
-RRB-
.
After
that
,
the
movi
and
the
book
begin
the
same
,
with
the
murder
of
Jack
William
-LRB-
Frederick
Down
-RRB-
,
a
one-arm
detect
and
Hammer
's
best
friend
.
Hammer
declar
that
he
will
seek
vengeanc
for
Jack
's
death
,
and
with
the
help
of
his
devot
secretari
,
the
blond
and
shape
Velda
-LRB-
Lauren
Landon
-RRB-
,
and
the
altern
friend
/
antagonist
polic
chief
Pat
Chamber
-LRB-
Paul
Sorvino
-RRB-
,
he
is
immedi
on
the
killer
's
trail
.
Here
the
movi
split
complet
from
the
book
,
and
dive
into
a
convolut
and
improb
tale
of
govern
conspiraci
and
mind
control
tactic
involv
the
Mafia
,
the
CIA
,
one
of
Hammer
's
Vietnam
vet
buddi
,
and
a
kinki
sex
clinic
.
Mani
of
the
same
charact
from
the
book
appear
in
the
movi
,
but
they
take
on
slight
differ
role
.
For
instanc
,
Charl
Kalecki
-LRB-
Alan
King
-RRB-
,
a
number
runner
and
narcot
dealer
in
the
book
,
turn
into
a
suav
mob
boss
.
And
,
more
import
,
Hammer
's
suspici
love
interest
,
Charlott
Bennett
-LRB-
Barbara
Carrera
-RRB-
,
morph
from
a
run-of-the-mil
psychiatrist
into
the
coordin
and
founder
of
the
sex
clinic
.
``
I
,
The
Juri
''
is
one
of
sever
cinemat
rendit
of
Spillan
's
book
-LRB-
includ
a
1953
version
which
was
made
in
3-D
-RRB-
,
but
this
film
differ
from
those
earlier
version
in
one
major
way
:
it
includ
all
of
the
sex
and
violenc
Spillan
wrote
about
that
could
never
be
given
screen
treatment
due
to
Hollywood
's
product
code
.
Although
this
take
the
1982
version
of
``
I
,
The
Juri
''
closer
to
the
core
of
the
origin
subject
matter
,
it
is
in
this
aspect
that
the
film
receiv
the
most
critic
,
becaus
it
took
this
new
licens
to
extrem
that
mani
argu
surpass
what
was
in
the
book
.
Rest
assur
,
the
movi
not
onli
includ
a
great
deal
of
nuditi
,
but
it
is
thorough
violent
,
especi
toward
women
.
It
featur
one
woman
have
her
neck
slash
,
a
set
of
twin
forc
to
strip
befor
be
stab
to
death
by
a
psychot
sexual
deviant
program
by
the
CIA
-LRB-
Judson
Scott
-RRB-
,
and
anoth
woman
shot
point-blank
in
the
belli
by
Hammer
himself
.
No
one
would
deni
that
Spillan
's
write
has
a
definit
misogynist
natur
,
but
the
movi
seem
to
take
it
a
step
further
by
give
it
such
glorious
screen
treatment
;
it
constant
equat
of
sex
and
violenc
,
much
of
which
is
play
with
the
intent
of
be
erot
,
is
quit
unsettl
.
It
's
no
surpris
that
the
movi
,
like
the
book
,
fade
to
black
with
a
dead
woman
on
the
floor
.
``
I
,
The
Juri
''
had
a
troubl
product
and
was
not
well-support
by
the
studio
that
made
it
,
which
is
one
explan
whi
it
did
n't
do
well
in
theater
and
mani
peopl
have
forgotten
that
it
was
ever
made
.
The
script
was
written
by
Larri
Cohen
,
who
is
best
known
for
his
creativ
cheesi
but
nonetheless
effect
monster
movi
,
like
``
It
's
Alive
''
-LRB-
1974
-RRB-
and
it
two
sequel
,
``
Q
''
-LRB-
1981
-RRB-
,
and
``
The
Stuff
''
-LRB-
1985
-RRB-
.
Cohen
wrote
the
script
think
he
was
go
to
helm
the
project
as
well
,
but
he
was
yank
from
the
director
's
chair
after
onli
a
week
's
worth
of
shoot
becaus
he
was
alreadi
$
100,000
over
budget
.
He
was
quick
replac
by
Richard
T.
Heffron
,
who
has
work
for
the
last
three
decad
on
a
hand
of
undistinguish
movi
and
dozen
of
televis
project
.
Heffron
was
obvious
brought
in
not
for
his
talent
,
but
becaus
he
could
make
the
movi
rapid
and
effici
.
It
show
in
the
final
product
.
Cohen
had
person
interest
in
the
updat
version
of
Hammer
,
but
Heffron
has
none
.
He
shot
the
movi
quick
and
clumsili
,
and
although
some
scene
ring
true
,
most
of
them
are
flat
,
trite
,
and
invari
dull
.
The
movi
featur
numer
car
chase
,
shoot-out
,
and
stunt
,
but
Heffron
's
background
in
televis
is
the
domin
tone
;
despit
the
graphic
violenc
and
full-front
nuditi
,
``
I
,
The
Juri
,
''
take
on
the
air
of
a
made-for-TV
quicki
,
with
no
real
punch
or
depth
.
But
the
problem
in
``
I
,
The
Juri
''
run
deeper
than
the
technic
.
The
central
fault
in
this
updat
is
Mike
Hammer
,
whose
charact
was
lost
in
the
shuffl
while
updat
from
the
fifti
to
the
eighti
.
Becaus
Spillan
wrote
all
his
Hammer
mysteri
in
the
first
person
,
Hammer
's
charact
is
central
to
the
tale
becaus
all
the
event
are
filter
through
his
persona
.
We
never
realli
get
that
impress
in
the
movi
--
there
is
no
first-person
voice-ov
narrat
and
some
scene
do
n't
have
Hammer
in
them
at
all
.
Consequ
,
a
great
deal
of
the
textur
of
Spillan
's
storytel
is
lost
.
The
period
updat
turn
out
to
be
a
detriment
bad
idea
becaus
much
of
Hammer
's
moral
code
is
thrown
to
the
wind
.
Despit
his
character
as
a
hard-nos
,
violent
,
misogynist
killer
,
Hammer
alway
stuck
fervent
to
his
own
moral
code
.
The
titl
itself
,
``
I
,
The
Juri
,
''
refer
to
his
anti-establish
notion
of
be
his
own
law
.
Unlike
privat
eye
who
seek
out
the
bad
guy
and
then
turn
them
over
the
polic
,
Hammer
both
pursu
the
crimin
and
exact
the
punish
.
In
this
way
,
he
can
be
seen
as
``
abov
the
law
,
''
but
he
still
adher
strict
to
her
own
person
code
of
conduct
,
his
own
moral
.
The
movi
forgo
that
aspect
of
his
charact
,
and
Hammer
come
off
not
onli
as
amor
in
societi
's
term
,
but
in
ani
term
,
especi
his
own
.
If
anyth
,
Hammer
alway
had
his
profession
,
but
the
movi
doe
away
with
that
in
the
first
three
minut
by
show
him
roll
in
the
sack
with
the
wife
of
a
client
who
had
paid
him
to
find
out
if
that
wife
was
be
unfaith
.
Mayb
the
scene
was
intend
for
laugh
,
but
it
onli
cheapen
Hammer
's
charact
and
is
,
by
all
account
,
a
lousi
way
to
start
the
movi
.
The
blame
for
Hammer
's
charact
ca
n't
be
laid
on
Assant
's
shoulder
,
becaus
despit
some
unnecessari
Marlon
Brandon-lik
mumbl
,
he
deliv
a
fine
perform
.
Spillan
never
onc
describ
Hammer
's
physic
attribut
in
ani
of
the
dozen
book
in
which
he
appear
,
so
ani
actor
could
conceiv
portray
him
.
Of
cours
,
becaus
of
the
lack
of
written
descript
,
those
who
have
read
Spillan
's
book
will
have
a
strong
person
notion
of
what
Hammer
look
like
,
and
therefor
almost
ani
screen
incarn
will
somehow
fall
short
of
expect
-LRB-
Spillan
,
who
play
the
charact
himself
in
1963
's
``
The
Girl
Hunter
,
''
is
general
consid
the
best
of
the
film
Hammer
-RRB-
.
The
rest
of
actor
are
most
un-noteworthi
.
With
the
except
of
Alan
King
and
Paul
Sorvino
,
everyon
who
appear
in
``
I
,
The
Juri
''
were
up-and-com
who
basic
went
nowher
.
Mani
of
them
end
up
work
in
televis
-LRB-
like
Carrera
,
who
had
a
short
stint
on
``
Dalla
''
in
the
mid-eighti
-RRB-
,
which
onli
add
to
the
made-for-TV
atmospher
of
the
film
.
Mayb
someday
,
someon
will
manag
to
get
the
right
element
togeth
and
make
an
effect
film
rendit
of
a
Spillan
book
,
but
this
is
certain
not
it
.
