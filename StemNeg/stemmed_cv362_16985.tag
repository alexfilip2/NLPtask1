VARSITi
BLUES
was
produc
by
MTV
,
and
it
realli
show
.
Sever
extend
scene
allow
for
a
continu
soundtrack
of
mediocr
pop
song
meant
to
appeal
to
the
adolesc
male
audienc
this
crap
was
intend
for
.
The
teenag
all
have
reason
for
their
melodramat
angst
.
The
adult
all
have
problem
,
of
cours
,
and
,
as
one-dimension
charact
,
they
are
all
fanat
obssess
with
how
their
local
high
school
footbal
team
perform
.
yes
,
this
movi
repres
high
school
life
in
MTV-Land
.
This
is
a
land
where
your
health
teacher
is
also
a
part-tim
stripper
,
your
ice
cream
store
attend
girlfriend
wear
an
Egyptian
Ankh
around
her
neck
,
your
kid
brother
form
a
``
cute
''
cult
,
your
footbal
coach
is
an
uncar
,
obssess
madman
,
and
your
friend
'
live
consist
of
noth
but
get
laid
and
drive
around
in
cop
car
nake
.
All
you
,
as
the
main
charact
,
want
to
do
,
howev
,
is
read
``
Slaughterhous
Five
''
and
attend
Brown
Univers
in
the
Fall
.
Well
,
at
least
this
is
a
littl
more
realist
than
MTV
's
``
The
Real
World
.
''
VARSITi
BLUES
star
Jame
Van
Der
Beek
,
this
week
's
teen
TV
star
make
the
leap
to
the
big
screen
.
He
play
the
hick
Moxxon
adequ
,
though
some
of
his
emot
dialogu
will
make
peopl
chuckl
.

Jon
Voight
,
the
stock
evil
guy
in
countless
other
movi
,
is
,
surpris
,
the
stock
evil
guy
here
.
But
is
he
realli
evil
,
or
is
he
a
product
of
societi
?
After
all
,
everybodi
,
young
and
old
,
in
this
movi
has
no
life
whatsoev
and
do
noth
but
obssess
over
high
school
footbal
.
Mayb
the
pressur
of
thescream
fan
at
the
footbal
field
drove
evil
coach
Kilmer
evil
.
The
film
's
screenplay
never
answer
this
burn
question
.
At
time
,
Iliff
's
stori
doe
show
glimmer
of
touch
or
humor
scene
,
but
,
befor
the
audienc
get
their
hope
up
that
there
might
be
someth
redeem
in
this
movi
,
they
get
trash
with
anoth
lengthi
parti
sequenc
or
overwrought
footbal
game
.
The
movi
's
pace
is
slow
,
and
the
plot
turn
are
mindnumb
obvious
from
start
to
finish
.
I
suppos
I
'm
be
a
littl
hard
on
VARSITi
BLUES
.
Mayb
I
'm
just
a
littl
mif
that
I
had
to
paybuck
to
see
it
,
even
though
it
was
dollar
night
at
the
cinema
.
Someth
about
a
request
from
the
studio
made
the
theater
charg
more
money
.
I
found
the
film
oftentim
ludicr
and
bore
.
Three
guy
in
front
of
us
smuggl
beer
into
the
the
theater
.
I
wish
I
had
thought
of
that
.
Alcohol
,
lot
of
it
,
may
have
help
the
view
experi
.
