The
central
theme
of
``
Sick
:
The
Life
and
Death
of
Bob
Flanagan
,
Supermasochist
''
are
pain
and
love
,
and
it
subsequ
effect
on
a
person
's
life
.
Its
protagonist
,
Bob
Flanagan
,
who
die
at
the
age
of
52
,
suffer
from
cystic
fibrosi
,
a
mortal
diseas
which
debilit
the
lung
by
satur
them
with
thick
coat
of
mucus
,
prevent
him
from
normal
breath
.
The
movi
is
about
much
more
than
recouper
-LRB-
or
attempt
to
-RRB-
from
this
diseas
.
An
audaci
,
fabul
triumphant
docudrama
,
``
Sick
''
chronicl
the
life
of
Flanagan
and
his
vicious
,
unthink
act
of
sadomasoch
conduct
with
his
mistress
of
15
year
,
Shere
Rose
,
who
amaz
provid
much
of
the
footag
for
the
film
.
Flanagan
's
idelog
cross
the
realm
of
rebelli
and
becom
transcendent
,
similar
to
Terri
Zwigoff
's
brilliant
1994
``
Crumb
''
,
which
also
explor
the
dysfunct
of
an
artist
by
paint
not
a
sympathet
portrait
,
but
a
realist
one
.
Both
Crumb
and
Flanagan
revel
in
their
defect
.
But
Flanagan
was
not
onli
a
man
content
on
endur
the
pain
via
lung
,
he
inflict
act
of
pain
on
himself
at
a
veri
young
age
,
courag
defi
God
-LRB-
he
was
an
Irish
Cathol
-RRB-
and
turn
his
bodi
into
a
work
of
art
,
which
he
unravel
in
museum
and
lectur
.
Behold
these
work
of
physic
art
.
Among
them
is
a
metal
ball
insert
insid
his
anus
,
and
,
--
the
most
disturb
scene
of
the
decad
--
,
nail
his
peni
to
a
board
.
Flanagan
was
a
man
of
great
intellig
,
wit
and
humor
,
as
well
as
adopt
a
sens
of
candid
scarc
seen
in
modern
filmmak
.
Not
onli
did
he
approach
his
diseas
with
humor
,
peform
burlesqu
act
in
front
of
an
audienc
,
he
was
also
revit
by
his
approach
.
Most
with
cystic
fibrosi
do
not
make
it
past
their
earlier
twenti
-LRB-
there
's
also
a
subplot
involv
a
femal
devote
who
knew
death
was
await
her
.
-RRB-
But
the
most
outstand
thing
about
``
Sick
''
is
Flanagan
's
relationship
with
Shere
.
Brim
with
honesti
,
sensual
stimul
and
unapologet
sad
moment
of
pain
,
their
power
bond
lift
``
Sick
''
into
a
rare
cinemat
high
,
where
we
forget
we
are
in
an
auditorium
and
becom
a
part
of
these
peopl
.
The
last
scene
,
where
we
see
the
hero
murmur
the
last
word
to
his
wife
in
a
hospit
bed
,
as
he
struggl
for
his
last
moment
of
life
,
is
raw
,
tender
,
hideous
.
It
goe
a
step
beyond
cinemat
intimaci
.
