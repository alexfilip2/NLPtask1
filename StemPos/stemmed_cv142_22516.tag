It
is
hard
to
imagin
that
a
movi
which
includ
abort
and
incest
as
promin
plot
devic
could
be
so
sensit
,
so
delic
,
so
insight
and
yes
,
even
so
enjoy
.
Somehow
,
THE
CIDER
HOUSE
RULES
manag
to
keep
an
even
keel
in
the
face
of
the
harsh
subject
matter
and
allow
a
substanti
amount
of
heart
to
shine
through
.

''
Such
is
the
result
of
an
insul
upbring
.
Though

certain
medic

Homer
remain
woefulli
naiv

to
find
his
place
in

world
,
he
must
go
out
into

.
Befriend
a
young
coupl
who
had
come
to

Tobey

is
well
cast
yet
again
as

He
demonstr
a

that
is
both

Michael

,
in

Call

Mr.

THE

ACCORDING

-RRB-
,
who
adapt
his
own
work
for
this
movi
deserv
much
of
the
credit
for
the
balanc
approach
to
the
sensit
subject
matter
.
Regardless
of
one
's
person
stand
on
the
divis
matter
of
abort
,
it
is
hard
to
imagin
anyon
becom
offend
by
the
evenhand
treatment
use
by
these
filmmak
.
The
titl
is
a
refer
to
a
list
of
rule
post
in
the
quarter
of
the
illiter
appl
picker
.
Figur
the
rule
did
n't
appli
to
them
sinc
they
did
n't
have
a
hand
in
write
them
,
they
decid
to
ignor
the
list
and
make
up
their
own
rule
as
they
go
along
.
Dr.
Larch
,
in
his
own
way
,
act
similar
.
There
is
a
danger
in
that
line
of
reason
.
God
has
also
given
us
a
set
of
rule
.
Unlike
the
list
post
in
the
cider
hous
,
God
's
rule
,
if
follow
,
promis
us
benefit
beyond
our
imagin
.
And
yet
,
mani
continu
to
ignor
His
``
rule
''
prefer
to
make
up
their
own
as
they
go
through
life
.
``
Trust
in
the
LORD
with
all
thine
heart
;
and
lean
not
unto
thine
own
understand
