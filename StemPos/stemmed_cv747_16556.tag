Edward
Zwick
's
``
The
Sieg
''
rais
more
question
than
it
can
convinc
answer
or
even
clear
articul
.
Its
subject
is
the
rise
threat
of
terror
in
American
citi
.
Denzel
Washington
is
Anthoni
``
Hub
''
Hubbard
,
who
run
the
FBI
's
anti-terror
task
forc
in
New
york
.
His
investig
into
Arab
terrorist
cell
intensifi
when
suicid
bomber
take
out
a
busload
of
peopl
.
Hub
focus
on
a
mysteri
CIA
oper
-LRB-
Annett
Bene
-RRB-
,
whose
goe
by
both
``
Elise
''
and
``
Sharon
.
''
As
the
terrorist
attack
continu
and
the
bodi
count
rise
,
the
question
of
martial
law
is
rais
.
Enter
Gener
Devereaux
-LRB-
Bruce
Willi
-RRB-
,
who
oppos
martial
law
at
first
but
who
,
as
soon
as
the
Presid
decid
to
send
in
the
Armi
,
begin
herd
Arab
immigr
into
a
prison
camp
and
attack
everi
link
that
Hub
uncov
in
the
terrorist
chain
.
Hub
listen
as
Devereaux
tortur
and
murder
a
suspect
.
The
futur
Zwick
and
screenwrit
Lawrenc
Wright
offer
is
all
too
possibl
.
What
would
happen
,
they
ask
,
if
terror
becam
as
much
a
fact
of
daili
life
in
New
york
as
it
is
in
citi
like
Beirut
and
Belfast
?
What
would
happen
to
our
civil
liberti
if
soldier
patrol
our
street
with
machin
gun
?
These
question
``
The
Sieg
''
answer
in
realist
detail
.
It
impli
tougher
one
,
though
:
what
can
be
done
to
combat
terror
without
sacrif
justic
and
freedom
?
if
we
encourag
terror
abroad
-LRB-
from
Bene
's
charact
we
discov
that
the
CIA
train
the
bomber
-RRB-
,
will
it
inevit
come
back
to
us
?
``
Sieg
''
avoid
the
tougher
question
by
endow
it
hero
,
Hub
,
with
a
uncompromis
sens
of
clear
right
and
wrong
.
This
comfort
fantasi
of
Sir
Galahad
confront
the
evil
of
the
modern
world
is
an
escap
from
the
thought-provok
issu
the
movi
rais
.
Still
,
Zwick
deserv
credit
for
at
least
address
the
issu
with
as
much
realism
as
he

where
