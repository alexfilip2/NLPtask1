The
1990s
produc
two
brilliant
scienc
fiction
film
.
One
was
_
Gattaca
_
.
The
other
was
_
The
Thirteenth
Floor
_
.
Just
as
_
Gattaca
_
was
overshadow
by
the
mighti
_
Titan
_
,
_
The
Thirteenth
Floor
_
was
releg
to
obscur
by
_
The
Matrix
_
.
Howev
,
_
The
Thirteeth
Floor
_
,
though
it
deal
with
similar
theme
,
is
a
much
better
movi
than
the
frenet
,
childish
and
improb
_
Matrix
_
.
A
cut
edg
comput
scientist
,
Hannon
Fuller
-LRB-
play
by
the
charm
Armin
Mueller-Stahl
-RRB-
,
is
murder
.
His
associ

Dougla
Hall
,
-LRB-
Craig
Bierko
-RRB-
appar
frame
and
suspect
by
the
polic
,
enter
into
the
simul
world
they
have
creat
in
order
to
unravel
the
mysteri
.
Along
the
way
a

Gretchen

more

and
a

about

_
The
Thirteenth
Floor
_
unfold
slowli
and
telegraph
it
punch
,
choos
to
elicit
the
more
complex
emot
respons
of
empathi
and
anticip
rather
than
the
cheap
one
of
mere
surpris
.
The
result
is
a
movi
that
is
a
failur
from
two
convent
point
of
view
.
First
,
it
plot
revel
can
be
foreseen
if
one
has
care
follow
it
complex
storylin
.
Second
and
more
serious
,
it
demand
that
it
audienc
think
and
feel
.
No
wonder
it
fell
through
the
crack
.
Done
in
film
noir
style
as
a
murder
mysteri
,
this
is
a
relat
deep
movi
that
function
on
sever
level
.
Mani
audienc
will
simpli
be
bewild
by
it
,
rather
than
engag
,
which
is
a
shame
,
becaus
this
movi
ampli
repay
a
littl
emot
and
intellectu
invest
.
I
recommend
a
second
view
simpli
to
get
the
flavor
of
the
frequent
iron
foreshadow
in
the
open
part
of
the
movi
.
Despit
it
philosoph
challeng
,
_
The
Thirteenth
Floor
_
deriv
it
emot
forc
from
the
love
stori
between
Jane
Fuller
-LRB-
Mol
-RRB-
and
Dougla
Hall
-LRB-
Bierko
-RRB-
,
as
well
as
the
close
friendship
between
Dougla
Hall
and
Hannon
Fuller
.
In
that
sens
it
is
more
akin
to
_
Gattaca
_
than
_
The
Matrix
_
,
which
,
for
all
of
it
cute
philosoph
byplay
,
is
an
adolesc
movi
with
no
emot
depth
whatsoev
.
The
moment
when
Jane
Fuller
confess
her
love
for
Dougla
Hall
is
at
onc
satisfi
,
wrench
and
intellectu
challeng
.
In
it
final
moment
the
film
even
take
on
itself
,
when
David
,
Jane
's
husband
,
who
has
come
to
enjoy
kill
,
accus
her
of
be
the
sick
one
.
Although
there
is
a
victori
for
the
lead
charact
,
this
resolut
suggest
a
disturb
element
of
fantasi
in
Jane
,
and
thus
a
deep-seat
charact
flaw
.
In
fact
,
Hannon
Fuller
's
activ
in
the
simul
world
,
the
behavior
of
Jane
's
husband
,
and
the
effect
of
enter
the
simul
on
Dougla
Hall
all
hint
at
similar
issu
with
those
charact
.
This
is
not
a
film
of
good
peopl
beset
from
without
by
great
evil
.
The
tragedi
is
not
in
their
star
,
but
in
themselv
.
The
major
actor
,
all
of
whom
are
requir
to
play
two
or
even
three
role
,
perform
extrem
well
.
Bierko
,
who
will
be
familiar
as
the
psycho
from
_
The
Long
Kiss
Goodnight
_
,
is
outstand
.
D'Onofrio
as
Whitney
,
who
play
a
pivot
role
in
support
,
also
turn
in
a
good
perform
.
The
love
Gretchen
Mol
,
whose
eleg
,
integr
,
and
determin
suggest
Bergman
in
_
Casablanca
_
,
doe
a
wonder
job
.
Her
voic
,
howev
,
lack
the
necessari
weight
at
time
.
This
could
be
becaus
she
was
given
the
worst
line
in
a
movi
whose
major
weak
is
the
script
.
Some
minor
flaw
,
hairlin
crack
in
fine
porcelain
,
appear
in
place
.
There
are
one
or
two
instanc
of
jerki
edit
.
The
script
take
the
edg
off
the
film
's
climax
.
The
atmospher
becom
too
claustrophob
at
time
-LRB-
yet
,
there
is
a
clue
there
too
-RRB-
.
One
wonder
if
even
after
two
decad
,
_
Blade
Runner
_
is
still
cast
it
long
shadow
over
sci-fi
film
.
One
can
see
a
group
of
suit
in
their
suit
,
wave
their
hand
imperi
at
director
like
the
Emperor
in
_
Amadeus
_
:
``
make
it
more
like_Blad
Runner
_
,
you
know
,
dark
and
raini
.
''
_
The
Thirteen
Floor
_
is
that
rare
except
among
Hollywood
movi
:
a
,
rich
,
emot
satisfi
,
intellig
sci-fi
movi
.
And
yet
,
ultim
,
it
prove
the
suit
right
.
For
when
good
sci-fi
is
made
,
where
is
the
SF
communiti
turn
out
in
drove
to
see
it
?
If
we
do
n't
support
great
SF
,
who
will
?
