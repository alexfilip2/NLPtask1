It
make
me
wonder
,
has
there
ever
been
a
music
montag
in
a

that
's
end
bad
?
I
onli
wish
real-lif
problem
could
be
solv
in
two

with
a
peppi
montag
.
For
the
curious
,
Mulan
doe
pass
for
a
man
in
the
armi
despit
look
like
a
girl
.
All
she
doe
to
transform
herself
is
cut
her
hair
to
a
sexi
shoulder-length
,
talk
macho
and
slap
guy
on
the
butt
,
as
was
male
custom
a
thousand
year
ago
in
China
.
The
decept
fool
everyon
but
the
audienc
,
who
think
she
might
be
abl
to
pass
for
a
12-year-old
boy
,
at
best
.
But
she
doe
manag
to
strike
the
biggest
blow
to
the
Hun
armi
,
led
by
a
big
,
evil-ey
Attilla-look
monster
.
As
a
villain
,
the
head
of
the
Hun
is
menac
,
evil
and
entir
forgett
.
I
saw
the
movi
yesterday
and
I
do
n't
rememb
the
man
's
name
.
Otherwis

The
anim

n't
as
rich
as
it
could
and
should
be
,
but
there
