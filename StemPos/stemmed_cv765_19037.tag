I
rememb
see
the
trailer
of
THE
BLACK
CAULDRON
on
the
PINOCCHIO
video
.
It
realli
scare
me
,
and
I
did
n't
want
to
go
see
it
.
Howev
,
after
I
heard
about
how
wonder
it
was
,
I
want
to
see
it
.
I
did
n't
get
a
chanc
to
do
so
,
until
now
.
The
film
,
Disney
's
25th
anim
featur
,
open
with
a
menac
shot
of
a
great
black
cauldron
unshroud
by
mist
as
a
narrat
begin
to
tell
the
tale
:
A
long
time
ago
in
the
land
of
Prydain
,
there
was
a
King
so
evil
,
that
his
spirit
was
captur
in
the
cauldron
.
It
has
been
hidden
for
centuri
,
and
whoever
possess
it
will
have
the
power
to
conjur
up
an
armi
of
deathless
warrior
,
and
with
them
rule
the
world
and
destroy
it
.
Then
,
we
meet
a
farmer-wizard
,
Dallben
,
and
his
young
apprentic
,
Taran
.
Taran
dream
of
be
a
warrior
instead
of

-LRB-
They

One

and
Dallben

after
watch
Hen
Wen
's
thought
through
a
bucket
of
water
,
that
Taran
must
hide
Hen
Wen
in
the
forest
.
An
evil
ruler
known
as
the
Horn
King
is
search
for
the
Black
Cauldron
,
and
onli
Hen
Wen
has
the
power
to
show
it
locat
.
Taran
lead
Hen
Wen
into
the
forest
,
but
of
cours
,
he
lose
her

and
tri
to
go
find

Along
the
way
,
he
meet
up
with
a
mischiev
littl
creatur
name
Gurgi
,
who
desir
`
munch
and
crunch
'
,
much
to
his
dismay
-LRB-
besid
,
he
stole
an
appl
that
Taran
was
tri
to
use
to
bring
back
Hen
Wen
-RRB-
.
When
he
hear
Hen
Wen
's
squeal
from
far
away
,
though
,
he
race
to
her
rescueon
to
see
her

.
Taran
chase
after
the
gwythant
and
find
himself
stare
at
the
Horn
King
's
castl
from
far
away
.
Taran
climb
the
castl
wall
,
and
bring
himself
into
the
castl
,
where
he
attempt
to
rescu
Hen
Wen
.
He
manag
to
do
so
,
but
he
is
himself
captur
and
thrown
into
the
dungeon
.
There
,
he
meet
Princess
Eilonwi
-LRB-
and
her
magic
baubl
,
anoth
thing
which
the
Horn
King
was
hope
to
use
to
find
the
cauldron
-RRB-
,
and
the
two
escap
through
the
deep
castl
wall
.
Along
the
way
,
Taran
find
a
sword
in
a
burial
chamber
,
and
they
rescu
a
comic
bard
name
Fflewdurr
Flamm
,
who
has
a
harp
whose
string
break
whenev
he
tell
a
lie
.
The
three
manag
to
escap
the
Horn
King
's
castl
,
but
not
befor
Taran
realiz
that
his
sword
is
magic
.
As
they
rest
in
the
forest
,
Gurgi
reappear
,
claim
to
have
found
Hen
Wen
's
trail
.
He
lead
Taran
,
Eilonwi
and
Fflewdurr
,
by
way
of
`
pig
track
'
,
to
a
whirlpool
.
Sudden
,
they
all
get
suck
under

and
they
meet
the
fairy-lik
Fairfolk
.
Taran
is
reunit
with
Hen
Wen
,
and
inform
that
the
Black
Cauldron
is
hidden
in
the
land
of
Morva
.
He
then
devis
a
crazi
idea
that
if
they
can
destroy
the
cauldron
,
it
would
prevent
the
Horn
King
from
destroy
their
world
.
With
the
help
of
a
grumpi
fairi
name
Doli
,
the
four
travel
manag
to
find
themselv
at
a
mysteri
cottag
.
It
turn
out
to
be
no
ordinari
cottag
;
three
comic
strang
witch
inhabit
the
place
.
When
Taran
tell
them
that
they
are
search
for
the
Black
Cauldron
,
they
agre
to
let
him
have
itin
exchang
for
his
sword
.
Taran
agre
,
much
to
Eilonwi
's
horror
,
but
at
least
they
get
the
Black
Cauldron
.
But
the
cauldron
ca
n't
be
destroy
,
onli
it
evil
power
can
be
stop
.
The
onli
way
to
do
so
is
for
a
live
be
to
climb
into
it
of
his
own
free
will
never
to
return
aliv
.
Thing
take
a
turn
for
the
wors
when
the
Horn
King
's
henchmen
captur
Taran
,
Eilonwi
,
and
Fflewdurr
,
along
with
the
Black
Cauldron
,
and
lead

Taran
,
Eilonwi
,
and
Fflewdurr
watch
in
horror
as
the
Horn
King
unleash
the
supernatur
power
of
the
cauldron
to
ressurect
his
armi

-LRB-
this
is
the
most
horrifi
scene
in
the
film
,
becaus
here
,
a
dead
armi
come
aliv
-RRB-
.
Just
when
all
seem
lost
,
though
,
Gurgi
reappear
,
and
rescu
Taran
,
Eilonwi
,
and
Fflewdurr
.
Taran
is
about

,
but

but
he

He

The

In

,
but
Taran
instead
has
a
new
trade
:

The

As

Fairfolk
onc
the
danger
are
past
-RRB-
,
Dallben
,
and
even
Doli
,
await
their
triumphant
return
.
As
spectacular
as
it
sound
,
THE
BLACK
CAULDRON
realli
suffer
a
lot
in
it
past
time
.
Befor
Ron
Miller
was
fire
from
his
posit
as
chairman
of
Walt
Disney
Product
,
he
had
bought
a
novel
by
Lloyd
Alexand
call
THE
BLACK
CAULDRON
,
a
sword
and
sorceri
tale
for
the
studio
.
Bring
this
book
to
the
screen
was
the
studio
's
fondest
dream
.
Miller
,
who
entitl
himself
as
the
execut
produc
,
promis
that
they
would
do
so
after
they
had
prove
themselv
on
other
project
.
When
Micheal
Eisner
and
his
execut
arriv
at
the
Disney
anim
studio
,
the
anim
were
struggl
to
complet
THE
BLACK
CAULDRON
.
By
this
time
,
thing
had
gone
realli
rocki
for
the
anim
depart
.
Mani
of
the
studio
's
old
men
had
retir
or
die
.
Therefor
,
the
anim
suffer
a
hard
time
make
this
film
.
Origin
budget
at
$
25
million
,
the
cost
rais
to
$
40
million
becaus
of
constant
chang
on
everythingand
when
it
was
final
releas
on
June
24
,
1985
,
THE
BLACK
CAULDRON
was
greet
by
prais
review
from
some
critic
,
but
somehow
the
film
flop
.
The
film
was
rate
PG
and
the
film
,
although
`
Disneyfi
'
from
Lloyd
Alexand
's
CHRONICLES
OF
PRyDAIN
-LRB-
which
is
what
this
film
is
base
on
-RRB-
,
was
much
more
scarier
and
darker
than
Disney
's
other
previous
effort
,
such
as
THE
RESCUERS
and
THE
FOX
AND
THE
HOUND
,
which
is
probabl
whi
so
mani
peopl
consid
it
too
scari
and
stay
away
from
it
.
In
addit
,
other
critic
reject
it
for
have
`
no
heart
'
and
`
unmemor
'
,
compar
to
other
Disney
anim
featur
.
But
whatev
the
real
reason
,
THE
BLACK
CAULDRON
was
a
financi
disast
,
gross
onli
$
21
million
.
The
failur
of
the
film
ground
the
studio
's
anim
depart
,
and
exil
the
anim
team
to
annex
build
in
nearbi
Glendal
,
and
it
seem
like
anim
featur
would
no
longer
becom
a
part
of
the
studio
's
reput
.
The
next
two
Disney
anim
featur
,
THE
GREAT
MOUSE
DETECTIVE
and
OLIVER
AND
COMPANi
,
although
a
littl
more
lightheart
than
THE
BLACK
CAULDRON
,
did
n't
do
much
better
-LRB-
although
OLIVER
AND
COMPANi
gross
much
more
than
THE
BLACK
CAULDRON
and
THE
GREAT
MOUSE
DETECTIVE
-RRB-
.
Onli
with
THE
LITTLE
MERMAID
did
the
studio
regain
it
reput
for
success
anim
featur
.
As
for
THE
BLACK
CAULDRON
,
it
was
rereleas
in
some
citi
for
a
temporari
time
under
the
titl
TARAN
AND
THE
MAGIC
CAULDRON
.
Final
,
the
studio
lock
the
film
in
the
film
vault
and
deni
that
it
ever
even
was
releas
.
Becaus
of
all
this
,
you
might
ask
yourself
,
was
THE
BLACK
CAULDRON
realli
such
a
bad
movi
?
The
peopl
who
had
seen
the
film
did
n't
think
so
.
In
fact
,
mani
peopl
had
call
to
Buena
Vista
Home
Video
request
for
the
film
,
but
of
cours
,
they
deni
it
.
For
a
while
,
it
seem
like
THE
BLACK
CAULDRON
would
NEVER
be
releas
to
video
until
Septemb
1997
,
Disney
releas
THE
BLACK
CAULDRON
to
video
in
the
Unite
Kingdom
.
Few
peopl
import
the
video
from
England
and
convert
to
NTSC
-LRB-
includ
me
-RRB-
and
for
those
who
had
n't
seen
the
film
yet
-LRB-
I
am
includ
here
-RRB-
,
they
got
quit
a
treat
.
But
peopl
who
had
bootleg
copi
of
THE
BLACK
CAULDRON
notic
that
in
the
scene
where
The
Horn
King
rais
his
armi
of
deathless
warrior
,
aboutsecond
of
ghoulish
look
skeleton
were
slight
trim
so
that
the
film
would
get
a
U
rate
-LRB-
in
the
UK
,
the
U
rate
mean
Univers
:
Suitabl
for
all
age
,
kinda
like
their
own
version
of
G
-RRB-
.
Somewher
onlin
,
a
team
of
diehard
THE
BLACK
CAULDRON
fan
sign
a
petit
that
said
,
`
Bring
Back
The
Black
Cauldron
!
'
,
and
becaus
of
that
,
Disney
final
decid
to
releas
the
video
to
the
Unite
State
.
Befor
that
time
,
rumor
onlin
had
been
made
that
the
video
would
be
trim
,
like
the
UK
video
,
so
that
it
would
get
a
G
rate
,
and
that
they
would
add
in
song
.
Those
rumor
were
put
to
rest
when
the
Walt
Disney
Compani
announc
that
THE
BLACK
CAULDRON
*
would
*
be
releas
in
it
PG
rate
version
.
Even
still
,
when
it
was
final
releas
to
the
US
,
some
reaction
was
mix
.
Some
felt
that
it
was
inde
cut
,
but
some
felt
that
it
was
n't
.
But
these
where
onli
minor
critic
which
seem
laughabl
,
sinc
a
film
that
was
absent
for
thirteen
year
was
final
avail
.
As
for
myself
,
when
I
saw
the
movi
for
the
first
time
-LRB-
on
convert
NTSC
video
-RRB-
,
I
did
n't
expect
much
at
all
.
In
fact
,
I
had
heard
so
mani
mediocr
thing
about
it
,
that
I
did
n't
think
the
film
would
ever
be
such
a
good
film
.
Much
to
my
surpris
,
when
I
saw
the
first
few
minut
of
the
film
,
I
was
ask
myself
,
``
This
is
the
same
film
everyon
saw
?
''
The
one
that
flop
at
the
box
offic
?
The
one
that
critic
and
filmgoer
alik
call
``
a
bad
movi
''
?
This
doe
n't
seem
like
all
of
the
abov
.
Instead
,
it
's
a
classic
in
it
own
right
.
The
film
has
a
wonder
cast
of
charact
.
There
's
Taran
-LRB-
Grant
Bardsley
-RRB-
,
an
Assistant
Pig
Keeper
who
would
rather
be
a
warrior
than
a
pig-keep
,
the
stori
's
hero
.
The
critic
have
said
that
Taran
is
not
likeabl
at
all
,
but
the
opposit
is
true
.
He
is
brave
,
loyal
,
and
eventu
learn
a
lesson
about
friendship
later
on
.
There
's
a
likeabl
charact
here
!
Not
that
he
's
the
onli
likeabl
charact
in
the
film
.
There
's
Gurgi
-LRB-
John
Biner
-RRB-
,
a
lovabl
littl
,
uh
,
thing
who
remain
loyal
to
Taran
,
even
though
they
do
n't
quit
hit
it
off
at
first
.
But
anoth
likeabl
charact
is
the
bad
guy
comic
henchman
,
a
dwarf
name
Creeper
-LRB-
Phil
Fondacairo
-RRB-
,
who
is
loyal
to
the
film
's
imagin
and
sinist
villain
,
The
Horn
King
-LRB-
voic
gruesom
by
John
Hurt
-RRB-
,
yet
he
also
fear
his
neck
.
The
other
charact
,
includ
the
sidekick
,
a
spunki
,
but
sweet
princess
name
Eilonwi
and
the
comic
bard
Fflewdurr
Flamm
,
and
three
comic
wick
witch
who
hide
a
dark
secret
,
although
pleasant
and
likeabl
,
are
n't
quit
as
well
round
as
they
should
be
.
The
stori
itself
is
an
adventur
one
,
a
quest
involv
the
mystic
pig
,
Hen
Wen
,
the
black
cauldron
itself
,
and
an
armi
of
deathless
one
with
everyth
:
a
hook
open
to
a
spectacular
final
.
Elmer
Bernstein
's
music
also
tell
the
stori
perfect
,
in
a
dark
,
yet
calm
manner
.
The
anim
itself
is
surpris
good
consid
that
this
film
was
creat
in
the
darkest
time
of
the
studio
.
Even
though
there
are
some
occasion
effect
that
are
not
quit
good
,
like
the
ground
open
when
the
Black
Cauldron
rise
out
of
the
earth
,
the
anim
overal
is
top
notch
.
Overal
?
This
film
is
an
entertain
endeavor
.
Fan
unfamiliar
to
the
Lloyd
Alexand
CHRONICLES
OF
PRyDAIN
will
get
a
kick
out
of
this
one
,
except
young
kid
.
There
are
some
extrem
scari
scene
which
are
more
darker
than
Disney
's
other
film
-LRB-
although
some
consid
the
stamped
sequenc
from
THE
LION
KING
and
Frollo
observ
Esmeralda
in
the
fire
of
hell
in
THE
HUNCHBACK
OF
NOTRE
DAME
are
just
as
scari
-RRB-
,
which
is
the
main
reason
whi
this
film
is
rate
PG
.
Fan
familiar
to
the
Lloyd
Alexand
seri
will
recogn
the
differ
between
the
novel
and
the
movi
.
Even
though
it
doe
n't
have
all
of
the
ingredi
of
a
true
Disney
film
,
this
film
is
a
classic
in
it
own
right
,
and
deserv
a
far
better
chanc
than
what
it
has
been
given
.
That
better
chanc
has
final
come
.
Whatev
reason
about
whi
THE
BLACK
CAULDRON
was
such
a
big
failur
seem
to
have
disappear
,
and
the
film
has
final
achiev
it
place
among
