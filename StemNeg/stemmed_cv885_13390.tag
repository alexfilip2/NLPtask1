releas
earlier
this
year
,
is
an
apt
titl
comedi
about
two
plastic
coupl
hous
in
an
artifici
stori
.
Like
a
sitcom
with
joke
so
lame
that
it
would
be
imposs
to
overlay
a
laugh
track
on
it
,
the
movi
meander
along
insult
the
viewer
'
intellig
in
almost
everi
frame
.
The
script
by
Jame
Frey
and
the
director
is
fill
with
vapid
actor
who
read
meaningless
line
you
ve
heard
befor

in
what
she
assum
will
be
a
sure-fir
come-on
line

-RRB-
Max

Chicago
's
biggest
playboy
,
decid
to
get
marri
after
a
whirlwind
love
affair

Max
and
Sam
possess
two
irrit
person
,
and
they
hold
littl
chemistri
for
each
other
or
the
audienc
.
Max
is
play

David
Schwimmer
.
Schwimmer
,
whose
act
talent
is
play
charact
devoid
of
person
,
make
an
unlik
lover
.
His
costar
,
Mili
Avital
as
Sam
,
is
cut
from
the
same
cloth
,
so
they
can
be
argu
to
be
a
match
pair
.
After
all
,
peopl
of
the
same
intellig
are
natur
drawn
to
each
other
,
ditto
for
similar
look
,
so
whi
should
n't
the
personality-challeng

The
implaus
plot
has
Max
ask
his
best
friend
,
Jay
-LRB-
Jason
Lee
-RRB-
,
to
hit
on
Sam
as
a
test

suppos
to
tri
to
get
her

sleep
with
him

but
stop
short
of
the
actual

promiscu
by
natur
,
worri
that
his
futur
bride
may
have
the
same
need
to
sleep
around
as
he
doe
.
The
idea
of
flirt
with
the
beauti
Sam
make
Jay
so
sick
that
he
becom
unabl
to
eat
or
work
.
Neither
the
script
nor
the
actor
make
this
test
believ
.
``
The
64,000
question
is
:
How
do

Some

manag
to
be
funni

has
noth
to
recommend
it

KISSING
