A
disappoint
biographi
about
the
homosexu
relationship
of
two
famous
19th
centuri
French
poet
.
The
film
manag
to
remov
all
the
poetri
from
the
poet
and
instead
concentr
on
their
abras
person
.
The
result
is
mere
an
academ
exercis
,
leav
an
emot
vacuum
that
it
could
n't
build
on
to
show
them
as
the
poet
they
were
.
On
paper
,
this
should
n't
have
been
so
terribl
--
it
had
a
talent
director
in
Agnieszka
Holland
-LRB-
``
The
Secret
Garden
''
-RRB-
,
a
proven
screenwrit
in
Christoph
Hampton
-LRB-
Danger
Liaison
-RRB-
,
and
a
capabl
cast
.
But
the
film
was
done
in
by
it
inept
script
,
the
unapp
way
the
film
was
direct
,
and
the
miscast
of
Leonardo
DiCaprio
as
Rimbaud
.
I
found
his
perform
to
be
the
most
risibl
one
in
the
film
,
with
him
act
more
like
a
teenag
brat
than
a
young
genius
,
spout
obsen
without
give
a
hint
that
a
true
poet
lie
behind
that
facad
.
He
,
especi
,
look
bad
becaus
David
Thewli
as
Paul
Verlain
look
so
good
despit
the
turgid
dialogu
that
was
thrust
upon
him
and
how
thin
a
charact
he
was
forc
to
be
.
But
when
the
two
of
them
were
togeth
,
it
look
like
a
mismatch
.
Leonardo
's
Rimbaud
onli
made
the
young
poet
look
petul
and
crude
,
yet
we
know
from
Rimbaud
's
poetri
,
that
he
must
have
had
someth
go
for
him
becaus
his
poetri
was
awe
inspir
.
The
film
open
in
post-revolutionari
Franc
in
1871
,
the
16-year-old
Rimbaud
has
sent
the
establish
Symbolist
poet
Verlain
a
letter
with
his
poem
.
He
accept
Verlain
's
prais
and
invit
to
be
a
hous
guest
in
his
splendid
Pari
home
,
and
Rimbaud
leav
his
sullen
farm
in
rural
Charlevill
.
Once
there
,
Rimbaud
is
disappoint
in
the
bourgeoisi
household
,
has
an
immedi
conflict
with
Verlain
's
busti
18-year-old
wife
Mathild
-LRB-
Roman
-RRB-
,
and
find
to
his
regret
that
the
drunken
Verlain
love
his
rich
wife
for
her
bodi
and
that
he
live
off
her
famili
's
money
,
even
though
he
has
noth
els
in
common
with
her
.
When
Verlain
state
,
``
Poet
can
learn
from
one
anoth
,
''
Rimbaud
repli
in
a
haughti
tone
,
``
Onli
if
they
re
bad
poet
.
''
He
will
continu
to
treat
the
older
poet
like
dirt
for
the
rest
of
their
relationship
.
Verlain
prove
to
be
weak-wil
,
beat
his
wife
regular
,
and
play
just
as
despic
a
charact
as
Rimbaud
.
When
Mathild
's
father
kick
Rimbaud
out
of
the
hous
,
Verlain
find
him
in
a
room
hous
and
the
two
becom
lover
.
It
's
a
real
downer
to
watch
this
stori
unfold
into
a
seri
of
obnoxi
behavior
pattern
on
the
part
of
the
two
poet
,
which
lead
them
to
travel
togeth
and
Mathild
ask
for
a
divorc
.
In
Brussel
,
Verlain
get
arrest
for
sodomi
and
spend
two
year
in
jail
.
While
Rimbaud
becom
anger
at
the
literari
world
and
never
write
anoth
poem
after
he
becom
19
.
He
instead
goe
to
North
Africa
and
becom
an
adventur
and
a
gun-runn
,
and
after
ten
year
there
,
come
home
with
a
tumor
on
his
knee
and
die
a
chang
man
at
the
age
of
37
.
The
hopeless
relationship
between
the
two
is
what
the
pictur
cover
in
detail
and
that
was
not
veri
satisfi
.
The
film
end
on
a
whimper
...
with
Verlain
talk
with
Rimbaud
's
sister
about
her
brother
and
the
poem
of
his
he
still
possess
,
which
the
sister
want
destroy
so
as
not
to
embarrass
the
famili
or
ruin
the
name
of
her
deceas
brother
if
publish
.
This
film
was
especi
annoy
becaus
Rimbaud
's
poem
are
fill
with
a
visionari
tens
that
are
not
even
approach
in
this
film
,
as
the
film
onli
manag
to
skim
the
surfac
of
the
live
of
these
poet
and
complet
ignor
the
valu
of
their
poetri
.
I
have
no
idea
what
the
filmmak
was
tri
to
say
in
this
film
,
but
whatev
it
was
,
it
just
did
n't
work
.
It
certain
did
n't
bring
ani
light
into
understand
what
Rimbaud
meant
to
modern
poetri
and
whi
he
earn
the
reput
as
the
so-cal
father
of
modern
poetri
.
