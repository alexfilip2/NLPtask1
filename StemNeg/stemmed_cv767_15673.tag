Everyth
about
this
ninth
Trek
movi
seem
on
the
cheap
,
from
the
Roger
Corman-grad
special
effect
to
it
high
deriv
and
ugli
ad
campaign
-LRB-
the
poster
is
near
ident
to
that
of
Star
Trek
VI
:
The
Undiscov
Countri
-RRB-
.
But
Piller
's
not-quite-half-bak
screenplay
should
ultim
claim
respons
for
Insurrect
's
failur
.
I
'm
about
to
give
the
same
advic
to
Rick
Berman
and
co.
as
I
ve
given
to
the
financi
of
Jame
Bond
movi
:
it
's
time
to
breath
life
into
this
workhors
by
hire
solid
genr
writer
and
a
real
director
.
-LRB-
While
we
re
at
it
,
put
that
visor
back
on
LaForg
!
-RRB-
For
three
hundr
year
,
the
Ba
`
ku
speci
-LRB-
who
look
just
like
human
-RRB-
have
live
on
a
ringed-planet
that
might
as
well
be
call
the
Fountain
of
youth
.
Six
hundr
of
them
occupi
the
Briar
Patch
,
the
area
affect
by
metaphas
radit
,
a
posit
energi
that
revers
the
age
process
in
the
elder
.
But
evil
Ru'afo
-LRB-
this
is
probabl
Abraham
's
last
stop
befor
perform
``
Amadeus
''
at
a
dinner
theatr
near
you
-RRB-
,
leader
of
the
Son
'
a
-LRB-
who
look
just
like
burn
victim
after
reconstruct
surgeri
-RRB-
,
want
to
reloc
the
Ba
`
ku
and
movi
his
peopl
onto
the
Briar
Patch
in
their
place
,
in
order
to
replenish
his
die
breed
.
The
Feder
is
all
for
this
,
but
Picard
feel
this
is
a
direct
violat
of
the
Prime
Direct
:
to
not
interfer
with
the
develop
of
an
alien
race
.
-LRB-
Never
mind
that
the
Ba
`
ku
did
n't
exact
evolve-they
went
wander
in
the
univers
one
day
and
stumbl
upon
the
magic
world
.
-RRB-
Everi
time
Frake
give
an
interview
late
,
he
seem
to
top
whatev
ludicr
statement
he
last
gave
regard
this
instal
.
He
has
call
it
a
comedi
,
a
think
man
's
pictur
,
a
throwback
to
the
old
seri
,
and
,
most
grievous
,
he
has
liken
it
to
a
John
Ford
western
.
-LRB-
I
presum
that
's
some
John
Ford
he
went
to
school
with
,
not
the
director
of
The
Searcher
.
-RRB-
He
has
also
gone
on
record
as
say
Paramount
recut
the
film
from
his
version
.
That
's
no
excuse-someon
generat
this
footag
.
Muddi
cinematographi
and
sitcom
set
are
the
least
of
it
problem
;
Star
Trek
:
Insurrect
appear
to
have
been
beam
in
from
the
planet
Plotholia
.
Consid
such
curios
...
Picard
's
love
interest
,
Anij
-LRB-
Donna
Murphi
-RRB-
,
can
slow
thing
down
by
stare
at
them
-LRB-
such
as
a
waterfal
or
fall
rock
-RRB-
-
her
scientif
explan
for
this
?
``
Do
n't
ask
.
''
Worf
get
a
pimpl
-LRB-
he

atmospher
-RRB-
,
LaForg
regain
his
eyesight
-LRB-
trust
me
,
Levar
Burton
's
real
eye
are
scarier
than
those
electron
lens
he
wore
in
First
Contact
-RRB-
and
Troi
brag
about
her
firm
boob
,
but
Picard
remain
as
bald
as
an
android
's
butt
.
Most
suspici
,
what
exact
is
the
problem
with
let
this
endang
race
have
a
littl
fun
in
the
sun
?
The
filmmak
cloud
the
issu
with
some
nonsens
about
a
famili
feud
of
sort
,
and
they
also
turn
Ru'afo
into
a
complet
power-mad
superfreak
,
just
so
the
charact
will
have
someth
to
do
in
the
climax
.
-LRB-
And
if
you
ve
seen
Return
of
the
Jedi
,
you
ve
seen
the
end
of
this
movi
.
-RRB-
Did
n't
Picard
himself
previous
disobey
the
Prime
Direct
when
he
prevent
the
Borg
from
assimil
million
?
Frake
luck
out
with
First
Contact
,
and
repeat
view
of
that
film
reveal
the
seed
of
what
went
wrong
in
his
direct
of
Insurrect
:
he
has
no
sens
of
comic
time
,
and
he
mine
for
act
chemistri
where
none
exist
.
-LRB-
Take
a
look
at
the
pain
``
Troi
get
drunk
''
scene
in
FC
and
you
ll
get
the
general
idea
of
Insurrect
's
unsuccess
jokey
and
hollow
tone
.
-RRB-
Even
the
worst
Shatner
and
co.
.
Trek
,
like
The
Final
Frontier
,
maintain
a
watchabl
thank
to
the
effortless
,
charm
comaraderi
between
Kirk
,
Spock
,
and
Bone
.
Neither
First
Contact
nor
Insurrect
has
ani
idea
what
to
do
with
Crusher
-LRB-
Gate
McFadden
,
whom
I
must
say
maintain
a
fabul
physiqu
-RRB-
,
Troi
,
or
LaForg
.
And
all
three
Next
Gener
film
spend
too
much
time
on
Data
,
who
is
the
franchis
's
answer
to
Urkel
.
Need
a
cheap
laugh
?
Have
Data
say
someth
sexual
,
or
start
sing
,
or
lift
up
a
four
hundr
pound
boulder
as
if
it
's
the
hunk
of
styrofoam
it
realli
is
.
Here
's
my
propos
titl
for
number
10
:
Data
Star
Data
Trek
:
Data
Data
Data
Data
Data
.
In
this
movi
,
Data
will
becom
preoccupi
with
learn
to
blow
his
nose
,
while
Crusher
and
Troi
watch
silent
from
500
yard
away
and
LaForg
point
his
sinist
gaze
at
the
android
in
doubli
robot
observ
.
Star
Trek
:
Insurrect
had
one
nice
,
eeri
,
silent
moment
that
hint
at
a
better
,
darker
film
.
I
'm
not
say
all
of
them
should
be
Star
Trek
II
:
The
Wrath
of
Khan
,
but
this
one
bold
went
where
no
movi
should
go
again
.
