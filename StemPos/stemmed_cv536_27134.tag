I
ll
be
the
first
to
admit
I
did
n't
expect
much
from
The
Emperor
's
New
Groov
:
More
Celin
Dion-esqu
song-and-d
number
,
cudd
charact
that
becom
cross-promot
devic
in
McDonald
's
Happi
Meal
,
and
Hollywood
star
tri
to
gain
credibl
by
ad
a
voice-ov
job
to
their
resum
.
I
was
dead
wrong
about
all
of
those
thing
.
The
Emperor
's
New
Groov
is
funni
.
Damn
funni
.
And
the
cute
charact
in
the
film
are
the
danger
one
.
The
script
is
fast
and
furious
,
with
no
sing
and
danc
.
The
anim
is
clean
and
would
give
Walt
a
warm
feel
all
over
.
The
humor
is
dri
and
aim
at
both
the
cynic
and
the
good
in
all
of
us
.
The
stori
is
ridicul
weird
and
come
off
as
a
strang
acid
trip
involv
talk
,
cross-dress
llama
and
schizophrenia
.
Here
's
the
plot
;
tri
to
follow
along
.
Set
in
a
mythic
kingdom
,
the
film
follow
the
adventur
of
Kuzco
-LRB-
David
Spade
-RRB-
,
an
arrog
and
egocentr
emperor
.
When
Kuzco
fire
his
power-hungri
advisor
,
yzma
-LRB-
Eartha
Kitt
-RRB-
,
she
and
her
``
assist
''
Kronk
-LRB-
Seinfeld
's
Patrick
Warburton
-RRB-
chang
him
into
a
llama
.
Kuzco
then
get
strand
in
the
jungl
and
must
reli
on
Pacha
-LRB-
John
Goodman
-RRB-
,
a
llama-herd
whose
home
was
to
be
replac
by
Kuzco
's
Water
World
Theme
Park
,
to
save
him
.
Then
the
fun
start
.
For
the
next
sixti
minut
,
the
audienc
is
treat
to
someth
unheard
of
in
Disney
film
these
day
:
Imagin
.
yzma
,
voic
by
the
talent
singer
Eartha
Kitt
,
look
like
a
cross
between
Norma
Desmond
,
Joan
Crawford
,
and
a
realli
old
Vega
showgirl
.
The
dialogu
between
her
and
her
oblivi
assist
Kronk
is
quick
,
sharp
,
and
feel
like
an
episod
of
Seinfeld
-LRB-
which
would
make
sens
-RRB-
.
David
Spade
and
John
Goodman
's
charact
interact
make
you
feel
like
you
re
watch
an
old
Hope/Crosbi
film
.
Spade
is
beyond
dri
with
his
humor
and
shoot
below
the
belt
on
sever
occas
,
and
I
laugh
out
loud
sever
time
.
Needless
to
say
,
that
is
an
extrem
rare
thing
in
Disney
screen
these
day
.
The
best
part
about
The
Emperor
's
New
Groov
is
how
audaci
the
film
is
.
The
sheer
weird
factor
is
veri
high
.
Cross-dress
,
schizophrenia
,
dualiti
of
soul
,
peopl
be
turn
into
everi
anim
on
Noah
's
boat
,
llama
CPR
,
homoerot
tendenc
,
an
Emperor
with
his
own
theme
song
and
singer
,
Michael
Jackson
danc
move
,
and
a
guy
that
can
communic
with
a
squirrel
are
onli
a
few
of
the
odditi
that
make
the
film
a
true
orgin
.
Simpli
put
,
The
Emperor
's
New
Groov
is
one
of
the
best
children
's
film
out
for
this
holiday
season
.
Kid
will
enjoy
the
adventur
,
and
parent
will
enjoy
the
stori
and
dialogu
.
That
's
a
tough
thing
to
pull
off
in
a
singl
packag
,
but
this
Emperor
manag
to
do
it
.
