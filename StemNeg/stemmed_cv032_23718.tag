Hong
Kong
cinema
has
been
go
through
a
bad
spell
.
The
last
few
product
have
been
effect
lade
action
adventur
that
combin
both
the
best
and
worst
of
American
filmmak
with
the
same
qualiti
of
Hong
Kong
film
.
In
a
nutshel
,
the
current
crop
of
film
from
Hong
Kong
has
been
madden
convolut
and
visual
sumptuous
.
With
the
one
time
British
coloni

back
to
Mainland
ownership
,
a
lot
of
Hong
Kong
's
best
talent
have
cross
the
pacif

work
on
U.S.
product
.
Such
talent
as

Now

Unfortun
``
Romeo
Must
Die
''
bear
all
the
trademark
of
a
typic
Hollywood
action
film
and
none
of
Hong
Kong
's
rhythm
.
The
film
open
in
a
nightclub
as
an
Asian
Coupl

neck
.
Enter
a
group
of
Chines
gangster
led
by

A
battl
break
out
between
the
bodyguard
of
the
club
and
Kai
,
who
handili
kick
and
punch
his
oppon
down
.
It
's
not
until
club
owner
Silk
-LRB-
rapper
DMX
-RRB-
,
bear
down
on
Kai
and
his
henchmen
that
the
fight
end
.
The
follow
morn
Po
Sing
is
found
dead
.
Suspicion
escal
,
as
Issac
O'Day
-LRB-
Delroy
Lindo
-RRB-
is
told
of
the
murder
.
His
concern
that
the
war
between
his
and
the
Chines
famili
may
explod
and
ruin
his
plan
to
move
out
of
the
busi
of
corrupt
and
into
a
legitim
ventur
.
Issac
implor
his
chief
of
secur
,
Mac
-LRB-
Issiah
Washington
-RRB-
to
watch
after
his
son
and
daughter
.
The
scene
shift
to
a
prison
in
China
,
where
Han
Sing
-LRB-
Jet
Li
-RRB-
learn
of
his
brother
murder
.
He
fight
with

and
is

,
Han

his

a
blister
display

work
.
Escape
to
the
U.S.
Han
set
out
to
find
the
person
respons
for
his
brother
's
death
.
``
Romeo
Must
Die
''
is
in
mani
way
a
fun
film
.
It
is
both
absurd
and
assur
.
The
basic
plot
of
a
gangster
want
to
becom
legitim
echo
``
The
Godfath
''
.
The
relationship
between
Jet
Li
's
Han
and
Aaliyah
's
Trish
O'Day
remind
us
of
Abel
Ferrera
's
``
China
Girl
''
,
except
that
Romeo
Must
Die
's
coupl
never
onc
exchang
more
than
a
love
glanc
toward
one
anoth
.
Their
romanc
is
much
more
puritan
than
ani
other
romanc
in
film
histori
.
The
perform
are
adequ
if
not
fulli
accept
.
Li
,
of
cours
has
the
showiest
part
,
have
to
express
both
an
innoc
and
steadfast
determin
.
Allayah
,
in
her
featur
film
debut
manag
to
carri
what
littl
is
ask
of
her
with
a
certain
style
and
grace
.
It
's
obvious
that
the
camera
love
her
and
she
is
veri
photogen
.
But
,
still
the
part
is
under
written
in
such
a
way
that
even
a
poor
perform
would
not
have
affect
it
.
Delro
Lindo
as
Issac
O'day
carri
himself
well
in
the
film
.
An
unsung
and
under
appreci
actor
,
Mr.
Lindo
turn
out
the
film
best
perform
.
The
other
perform
are
all
adequ
in
what
the
script
ask
of
them
except
for
D.
B.
Woodsid
as
Issac
's
son
,
Colin
.
The
perform
is
undirect
,
with
the
charact
chang
his
tone
and
demeanor
in
accord
with
whatev
locat
he
is
in
.
An
unfocus
perform
that
should
have
been
reign
in
and
/
or
better
written
.
First
time
director
Andrzej
Bartkowiak
doe
a
workmanlik
job
in
handl
the
film
.
Have
a
career
as
one
of
the
industri
's
best
cinematograph
,
Bartkiwiak
know
how
to
set
up
his
shot
,
and
``
Romeo
Must
Die
''
doe
look
good
.
But
the
pace
of
the
film
is
letharg
,
onli
come
to
a
semblanc
of
life
dure
the
fight
scene
.
The
script
by
Eric
Bernt
and
John
Jarrel
is
not
focus
in
such
a
way
that
we
can
care
about
the
charact
or
the
situat
they
are
in
.
The
big
gambit
of
buy
up
waterfront
properti
to
facilit
the
build
of
a
sport
center
for
a
NFL
team
is
needless
confus
.
And
of
cours
the
common
practic
of
one
charact
be
the
comic
relief
of
the
film
becom
pain
obvious
here
as
Anthoni
Anderson
as
Allayah
's
bodyguard
,
Mauric
has
no
comic
time
whatsoev
.
The
best
thing
about
the
film
are
it
fight
scene
.
Jet
Li
is
a
master
of
these
intric
physic
battl
.
One
need
onli
to
see
his
film
``
Fist
of
Legend
''
to
understand
that
the
man
is
without
peer
in
the
realm
of
Martial
Art
combat
.
Here
,
Jet
is
given
the
opportun
to
show
off
in
a
way
that
``
Lethal
Weapon
4
''
-LRB-
Jet
's
U.S.
debut
-RRB-
did
n't
allow
.
Unfortun
,
a
lot
of
Jet
's
fight
are
aid
with
comput
effect
that
detract
from
his
abil
and
precis
.
Also
``
Romeo
Must
Die
''
must
be
note
as
have
the
most
singular
useless
effect
ever
commit
to
film
,
and
that
is
an
x-ray
effect
that
appear
three
time
dure
the
cours
of
the
film
,
show
the
effect
of
bone
crush
blow
on
an
oppon
.
Obviousli
a
homag
to
the
fame
x-ray
scene
from
Sonni
Chiba
's
``
Streetfight
''
,
the
scene
here
are
just
pointless
and
interfer
with
the
pace
of
the
film
.
It
's
as
if
the
film
has
stop
and
a
video
game
has
been
insert
.
One
problem
though
about
the
fight
scene
.
Those
that
are
familiar
with
Hong
Kong
action
know
that
even
though
the
film
are
fantasi
and
are
as
remov
from
realiti
as
ani
anim
or
cartoon
.
They
do
have
an
intern
rhythm
to
them
.
A
heartbeat
,
so
to
speak
in
their
choreographi
.
The
fight
scene
in
a
Hong
Kong
film
breath
with
an
emot
reson
.
This
is
creat
by
the
perform
,
the
direct
and
the
edit
.
Here
in
``
Romeo
Must
Die
''
,
there
is
no
staccato
.
Everi
fight
scene
,
even
though
technic
adroit
and
amaz
becom
bore
as
the
edit
both
cut
away
from
battl
at
hand
and
simpl
follow
a
set
pattern
.
The
rhythm
is
monoton
.
A
Hong
Kong
film
has
a
tempo
that
chang
,
heighten
it
emot
impact
.
`
RMD
'
is
limit
to
a
standard
tempo
,
not
allow
for
ani
emot
content
whatsoev
.
A
fine
exampl
of
this
differ
can
be
found
by
examin
a
coupl
of
Jacki
Chan
's
film
.
.
watch
the
restaur
fight
from
the
film
``
Rush
Hour
''
and
notic
that
the
context
of
the
fight
,
while
technic
amaz
is
rather
flat
-LRB-
the
frame
and
cut
alway
do
not
help
-RRB-
.
Now
look
at
the
warehous
fight
from
``
Rumbl
in
the
Bronx
''
.
There
you
have
a
heartbeat
,
and
emot
draw
that
doe
n't
let
the
audienc
catch
it
breath
.
The
stop
and
paus
for
dramat
effect
work
perfect
,
caus
the
viewer
to
be
both
astound
and
flabbergast
.
Here
in
`
Romeo
Must
Die
'
,
the
fight
scene
have
no
more
emot
content
or
charact
than
ani
John
Wayn
barroom
brawl
.
Jet
Li
is
a
grand
and
person
screen
presenc
.
it
's
a
shame
that
his
full
talent
were
not
use
to
full
effect
here
.
One
day
filmmak
here
in
the
U.S.
will
stop
make
film
by
the
number
and
start
to
embrac
the
style
and
emot
that
has
made
Hong
Kong
action
pictur
such
a
commod
.
Until
then
,
we
ll
be
left
with
emot
hollow
product
like
``
The
Replac
Killer
''
and
,
current
``
Romeo
Must
Die
''
