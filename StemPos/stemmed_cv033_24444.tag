In
WONDER
BOyS
Michael
Dougla
play
an
age
writer
\
professor
with
such
lived-in
natur
that
I
believ
it
may
be
his
best
perform
.
Ever
sinc
WALL
STREET
,
Dougla
has
spent
the
greater
part
of
his
career
play
variat
on
the
shark
in
a
suit
Gordon
Gecko
charact
he
personifi
in
the
mid-80
's
.
In
those
perform
he
tend
to
exagger
the
vehem
of
cutthroat
businessmen
,
with
much
froth
at
the
mouth
while
project
all
his
bad
intent
to
the
world
.
you
'd
think
such
a
man
would
keep
his
evil
wrap
tight
underneath
a
good-natur
veneer
,
but
from
Gordon
Gecko
to
Nichola
Van
Orton
,
Dougla
play
the
role
straight
and
out
in
the
open
.
In
WONDER
BOyS
his
perform
is
n't
showi
or
a
tour
de
forc
,
it
's
simpl
yet
truth
.
He
embodi
Gradi
,
a
craggi
old
writer
with
a
predilect
for
pot
and
pink
bathrob
.
Gradi
instruct
a
writer
workshop
while
work
tireless
on
a
follow
up
to
the
novel
that
put
him
on
the
map
.
When
we
first
encount
this
curmudgeon
in
the
midst
of
his
workshop
,
we
hear
his
sardon
narrat
on
the
soundtrack
as
student
bombard
one
of
their
own
with
unfair
critic
.
Gradi
point
out
,
in
his
narrat
,
that
they
onli
do
so
out
of
jealousi
.
Their
target
is
the
veri
writer
name
Jame
Leer
-LRB-
play
by
the
alway
underst
Tobey
Maguir
-RRB-
,
a
student
full
of
potenti
and
one
whom
Gradi
develop
a
mild
affect
for
.
Leer
is
the
kind
of
youth
who
seem
to
mechan
block
out
emot
.
He
speak
in
an
intellectu
monoton
with
just
a
hint
of
dri
wit
around
the
edg
.
He
's
portent
and
gloomi
,
as
if
model
himself
after
the
great
depress
writer
,
though
his
act
is
a
littl
too
calcul
.
He
remind
me
of
the
self-impos
outcast
film
director
,
Jim
Jarmusch
-LRB-
DEAD
MAN
,
GHOST
DOG
-RRB-
.
Whenev
I
happen
to
catch
Jarmusch
in
an
interview
I
see
the
man
speak
in
a
toneless
manner
-LRB-
the
monoton
drawl
suppos
mask
depth
or
contempt
for
his
interview
-RRB-
,
exclus
dress
in
black
,
and
with
his
spike
hair
dy
snow
white
.
Leer
is
similar
,
a
guy
who
equat
quirk
with
depth
.
Tobey
Maguir
fit
well
in
the
role
.
With
his
round
,
sweet-eeri
face
he
resembl
Bud
Cort
from
HAROLD
AND
MAUDE
.
But
unlik
Cort
,
Maguir
is
easier
to
warm
up
to
;
he
's
a
mess
up
kid
reach
for
artist
credibl
.
Kati
Holm
play
Hannah
,
a
beauti
,
talent
write
student
just
itch
to
get
in
Gradi
's
pant
.
This
is
a
plot
line
I
had
troubl
with
.
Dougla
,
in
his
old
age
,
is
begin
to
resembl
Jerri
Springer
,
a
man
who
has
actual
paid
for
sex
on
numer
document
occas
.
At
first
I
found
it
extrem
difficult
to
believ
that
someon
as
beauti
as
Hannah
would
desir
Gradi
-LRB-
mayb
it
's
becaus
I
'm
jealous
,
and
wish
Holm
was
throw
herself
at
me
,
after
all
I
may
just
be
a
lowli
internet
critic
but
at
least
I
still
have
all
my
teeth
-RRB-
,
then
I
think
of
Dougla
's
real
life
companion
,
the
breathtak
Catherin
Zeta
Jone
.
See
those
two
togeth
look
a
lot
like
a
kidnap
.
Sudden
my
mind
has
shift
from
the
task
at
hand
-LRB-
that
be
review
this
complet
wonder
movi
-RRB-
and
I
'm
pontif
on
whi
the
hell
Jone
would
desir
Dougla
.
There
is
a
movi
in
there
somewher
.
Gradi
,
rather
chivalr
if
you
ask
me
,
resist
the
charm
of
Hannah
for
Sara
Gaskel
-LRB-
a
droll
Franc
McDormand
-RRB-
,
who
is
his
age
,
but
also
marri
to
anoth
professor
.
Okay
,
mayb
not
so
chivalr
.
There
is
a
great
line
in
the
film
spoken
by
Dougla
about
Sara
where
he
say
,
``
She
was
a
junki
for
the
print
word
.
''
Lucki
for
me
I
manufactur
her
drug
of
choic

Robert
Downi
J.r
play
a
bisexu
editor
who
make
his
entranc
with
a
tower
transvestit
on
his
arm
.
Downi
has
master
the
gleefulli
dri
hyper
articul
wit
of
mani
a
hipster
intellectu
.
He
's
arrog
but
complet
likeabl
in
his
utter
arrog
.
The
actor
is
perfect
cast
here
,
and
remain
a
joyous
movi
presenc
somewher
between
a
typic
Tom
Hanksian
comic
lead
man
and
edgi
charact
actor
.
I
wish
WONDER
BOyS
had
more
of
him
.
Search
for
a
plot
among
the
element
of
WONDER
BOyS
would
be
pointless
,
for
it
meander
through
it
run
time
,
but
that
's
part
of
it
charm
.
And
mayb
I
'm
a
bit
bias
toward
the
film
becaus
it
take
place
in
a
haven
of
literari
academia
,
a
place
I
'm
great
fond
of
,
and
a
place
rare
explor
in
American
cinema
.
Everyon
has
a
sub-genr
-LRB-
be
it
war
film
,
western
,
danc
movi
-RRB-
that
they
happen
to
be
privi
to
.
I
'm
privi
to
film
about
literari
type
i.e.
those
individu
enthral
by
the
written
word
,
and
if
you
are
not
so
inclin
it
may
be
wise
to
knock
my
abov
grade
down
about
half
a
notch
.
The
direct
by
Curti
Hanson
is
more
akin
to
a
European
film
with
it
leisur
pace
and
situat
that
grow
from
the
charact
,
rather
than
generic
map
out
stori
point
.
Sometim
the
dialogu
is
too
clever
,
but
that
's
a
problem
I
wish
I
found
with
film
more
often
.
Another
minor
quibbl
is
that
earli
on
the
film
seem
a
bit
too
introvert
,
like
it
charact
,
but
as
the
stori
progress
it
begin
to
open
up
.
For
me
WONDER
BOyS
work
as
subtl
drama
becaus
of
it
insight
into
artist
type
,
and
as
a
low-key
comedi
for
it
chuckle-worthi
throwaway
gag
.
The
gag
are
like
those
in
the
great
Robert
Altman
-LRB-
M
*
A

S
*
H
,
THE
LONG
GOODByE
-RRB-
movi
,
where
joke
exist
as
asid
on
the
fring
,
like
joke
in
life
often
do
.
The
broader
comedi
such
as
the
kill
of
a
blind
dog
,
and
incess
smoke
of
marijuana
is
n't
ineffect
but
not
near
as
memor
as
the
littl
thing
.
Curti
Hanson
,
who
befor
his
last
film
,
LA
CONFIDENTIAL
,
toil
about
with
exploit
fare
like
LOSIN
'
IT
-LRB-
an
earli
Tom
Cruis
sex
comedi
-RRB-
and
THE
HAND
THE
ROCKS
THE
CRADLE
,
has
graduat
to
more
meaning
film
.
He
direct
WONDER
BOyS
in
an
appropri
dour
style
,
the
comedi
come
from
the
fals
gloom
his
charact
put
up
.
The
moros
croon
of
Leonard
Cohen
would
seem
an
odd
song
for
the
background
of
ani
parti
,
but
in
a
WONDER
BOyS
parti
,
it
fit
.
The
film
is
like
a
piec
of
literatur
put
up
on
the
big
screen
.
It
's
the
cinemat
equival
to
a
good
read
,
novelist
in
it
approach
with
theme
rare
found
in
American
movi
.
Mani
will
find
it
slight
,
but
I
found
much
to
savor
among
it
subtleti
.
