Marti
,
you
see
,
is
a
grown-up
twin

Although

THE
HOUSE
OF
yES
.
Mother
and
daughter
,
play
in
a
brilliant
perform
by
Parker
Posey
,
are
both
vari
degre
of
wacko
.
Most
dysfunct
famili
in
the
movi
are
more
angri
and
mean-spirit
than
diabol
abnorm
as
this
one
is
.
The
daughter
's
fantasi
of
be
Jackie-O
is
probabl
the
most
sane
part
of
her
be
.
Mrs.
Pascal
is
the
sort
that
will
not
let
Jackie-O
keep
a
hairbrush
downstair
sinc
food
is
kept
on
that
level
.
She
explain
to
Marti
's
new
fiance
,
Lesli
-LRB-
Tori
Spell
-RRB-
,
soon
after
their
first
meet
that
Jackie-O
was
hold
Marti
's
privat
part
when
she
came
out
of
the
womb
.
The
dialog
by
Wendi
MacLeod
,
base
on
the
play
by
Mark
Water
,
is
so
sharp
and
bite
that
it
seem
in
danger
of
cut
through
the
celluloid
at
ani
moment
.
The
script
,
reminisc
of
a
David
Mamet
play
,
flow
smooth
with
it
fast
pace
intellig
and
mesmer
set
of
bizarr
charact
.
The
exagger
setup
has
Lesli
and
Marti
arriv
at
the
famili
's
out
of
the
way
mansion
dure
a
Thanksgiv
Day
hurrican
.
In
this
storm
are
two
sane
individu
.
The
fiance
is
a
giddi
,
school-girl
type
,
embarrass
by
everyth
,
a
complet
contrast
to
her
rival
Jackie-O
's
bitter
pseudo-sophist
.
As
the
two
twin
'
younger
brother
,
Anthoni
,
Freddi
Prinz
Jr.
play
the
All-America
boy
type
whose
onli
foibl
is
his
explicit
obsess
of
bed
his
brother
's
fiance
that
night
.
``
We
all
have
our
secret

''
Jackie-O
tell
her
potenti
sister-in-law
,
and
boy
,
doe
she
have
a
few
.
This
is
a
hous

When
Lesli
call
it
the
famili

``

to
Mrs.

--
they
ve
never
had

In
a
film
that
give
new
mean
to
the
phrase
,
``
made
for
each
other
,
''
the
twin
's
biggest
,
but
not
their
onli
secret
,
is
that
they
ve
had
a
long-term
incestu
relationship
.
They
do
n't
like
to
discuss
it
,
although
they
are
not
particular
asham
of
it
.
Perfect
for
viewer
who
can
appreci
pervers
comedi
,
this
stori
never
pull
it
punch
.
Jackie-O
tri
in
mani
way
,
few
subtl
,
to
show
that
she
is
a
better
match
for
Marti
than
that
ditzi
fiance
of
his
.
In
one
scene
Marti
and
Lesli
are
play
chop
stick
togeth
on
the
piano
when
Jackie-O
push
her
asid
and
start
play
a
challeng
classic
piec
for
four
hand
.
Marti
join
her
as
his
fiance
look
on
with
envi
.
The
chemistri
between
Parker
Posey
and
Josh
Hamilton
is
noth
short
of
amaz
.
They
put
down
their
littl
brother
and
most
of
the
other
sane
peopl
in
the
world
.
Their
ripost
are
engag
filmmak
at
it
best
.
Director
Mark
Water
keep
the
show
's
energi
level
high
and
let
the
lead
sling
zinger
at
each
other
at
a
furious
pace
.
His
crisp
direct
ensur
the
movi
has
nari
an
ounc
of
fat
on
it
.
Jackie-O
is
temperament
incap
of
be
nice
.
And
be
jealous
,
she
cut
Lesli
down
merciless
.
``
Were
you
poor
?
''
Jackie-O
ask
her
when
she
find
that
Lesli
commit
the
crime
of
grow
up
impoverish
.
``
Did
you
eat
pie
?
''
Chicken
pot

''
``

Lesli

``

''
Jackie-O

inquir
of
Marti
when
she
learn
that
Lesli
work
at
a
Donut
King
.
``
Are

royalti
?
''
With
Rolf
Kent
's
whimsic
sinist
music
it
never
seem
clear
where
the
stori
is
head
.
Will
it
end
in
a
big
emot

a

,
peopl
slowli
cut
each
other
up
with

The
emot
charg
play
is
clear
go
somewher
,
and
the
engag
charact
captiv
the
audienc
with
their
spell
.
I

not

more
except
that
the
end
is
perfect
and
a
bit
of
a
