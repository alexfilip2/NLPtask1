The Naive Bayes classifier is run using the Python file NaiveBayes.py which stemms the dataset if needed.
The accuracy results of the cross validation are written into the NaiveBayesAccuracies file.

The SVM classifier is run using the Python file SVMclassifier.py which stemms the dataset if needed.
The accuracy results of the cross validation are written into the SVMAccuracies file.

The sign test comparison is run using the Python file SignTest.py, which should be run AFTER the SVM and NaiveBayes
classifiers.
Its results are written in the SignTestResults file, including on-split p-values for each comparison.
