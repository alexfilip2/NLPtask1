Comment
:
I
may
be
show
some
pop
cultur
illiteraci
here
,
but
I
have
never
seen
an
episod
of
the
Fox
TV
seri
``
Parti
of
Five
.
''
I
am
onli
vagu
awar
of
the
show
's

and
my
knowledg
of
it
come
from
brief

``
Parti
of
Five
,
''
I
do
know
howev
,
seem
to
be
the
start
ground
for
actress
in
the
teen
horror
genr
.
Neve
Campbel
,
Scream
Queen
of
the
90s
and
star
of
SCREAM
,
SCREAM
2
,
and
THE
CRAFT
,
is
a
regular
of
the
show
.
So
too
is
Jennif
Love
Hewitt
.
Lo
and
behold
,
follow
in
the
footstep
of
Campbel
,
Hewitt
now
has
a
horror
franchis
of
her
own
:
the
I
KNOW
WHAT
yOU
DID
LAST
SUMMER
line
.
Though
the
origin
film
,
releas
last
year
,
was
watchabl
enough
,
this
insipid
sequel
had
me
look
at
the
theater
's
glow
red
EXIT
sign
long
throughout
.
Jennif
Love
Hewitt
is
a
veri
good-look
young
lead
ladi
;
howev
,
unlik
Neve
Campbel
,
Hewitt
struggl
with
act
.
She
just
is
n't
convinc
in
this
film
-LRB-
and
she
was
n't
in
the
origin
either
-RRB-
.
This
put
mani
young
male
,
includ
myself
,
in
a
paradox
quandari
:
she
's
veri
attract
,
but
the
annoy
,
spoil
,
Valley
Girl-typ
charact
she
tri
to
play
here
is
annoy
to
the
extrem
and
ruin
mani
of
the
scene
which
emphas
,
exploit
,
her
figur
.
Add
to
the
mix
the
equal
pleasant
yet
irrit
Brandi
,
anoth
rise
teen
TV
star
,
and
you
get
one
frustrat
male
audienc
.
I
ve
spent
so
much
time
on
Hewitt
and
Brandi
for
a
reason
.
I
STILL
KNOW
WHAT
yOU
DID
LAST
SUMMER
,
though
cash
in
on
the
success
of
the
origin
,
ultim
serv
as
a
vehicl
for
these
two
young
actress
.
Noth
els
here
is
origin
or
interest
.
This
movi
,
in
fact
,
make
other
recent
so-so
horror
film
like
URBAN
LEGEND
and
JOHN
CARPENTER
'S
VAMPIRES
seem
like
stun
work
of
high
art
.
I
STILL
KNOW
reli
heavili
on
tire
slasher
film
clich
:
an
isol
locat
,
a
storm
,
parentless
teenag
,
fals
alarm
nightmar
,
lot
of
blue-light
dark
scene
,
a
garb
slasher
who
walk
around
in
the
background
without
the
charact
see
him
,
knive
and
other
sharp
instrument
lie
around
everywher
,
etc.
.
you
get
the
pictur
.
The
entir
audienc
know
all
the
secondari
charact
introduc
in
the
film
are
go
to
receiv
the
busi
end
of
the
killer
's
hook
.
They
may
as
well
have
huge
target
paint
on
them
.
Like
SCREAM
and
it
numer
knockoff
,
these
secondari
charact
are
suppos
to
serv
as
comic
relief
.
Unfortun
,
I
STILL
KNOW
's
charact
are
n't
all
that
funni
.
In
particular
,
one
charact
,
a
chain-weed-smok
guy
,
is
obnoxi
annoy
and
certain
doe
n't
die
soon
enough
.
The
death
scene
,
by
the
way
,
are
relat
violent
for
a
theatric
releas
horror
film
.
Sever
of
them
are
uncomfort
to
watch
,
and
they
remind
me
of
the
sicken
gore
scene
in
HELLRAISER
:
BLOODLINE
,
a
truli
sadist
movi
.
This
,
too
,
did
not
help
the
suppos
humor
I
STILL
KNOW
was
shoot
for
.
And
what
is
the
deal
with
the
slasher
himself
?
I
know
that
the
slasher
film
is
not
a
particular
intellig
genr
,
but
Ben
Willi
has
got
to
go
down
as
one
of
the
most
silli
slasher
in
mainstream
horror
.
Come
on
,
the
guy
look
like
the
Gorton
's
fisherman
,
and
his
gruff
voic
make
him
sound
like
a
Disney
pirat
.
Though
his
lightning-lit
appear
ellicit
much-need
laughter
in
the
theater
,
his
appear
border
on
the
absurd
in
the
horror
film
,
and
that
's
realli
say
someth
.
So
,
all
that
's
left
to
talk
about
here
is
Jennif
Love
Hewitt
and
Brandi
.
Both
pranc
about
in
tightfit
,
reveal
outfit
or
in
various
state
of
undress
,
yet
neither
of
them
ever
actual
do
a
nude
scene
.
Hewitt
,
howev
,
doe
do
a
post-show
scene
in
which
her
thin
bathrob
is
quit
...
titil
.
This
scene
alon
made
this
one-star
turkey
earn
two
star
under
my
rate
system
.
Otherwis
,
Hewitt
and
Brandi
both
grate
on
the
nerv
.
Ear
in
the
film
,
for
instanc
,
Brandi
win
the
trip
to
the
Bahama
.
She
and
Hewitt
jump
around
and
scream
and
screech
for
what
seem
like
forev
.
I
need
extra-strength
Tylenol
after
that
part
.
Oh
,
and
the
film
's
conclus
,
talk
about
repetit
!
Peopl
who
saw
I
KNOW
WHAT
yOU
DID
LAST
SUMMER
will
predict
I
STILL
KNOW
's
end
at
leastminut
befor
it
happen
.
Bore
!
I
saw
this
movi
with
my
brother
at
the
local
downtown
movi
theater
.
Admission
is
onli
one
dollar
on
Wednesday
,
and
we
often
go
see
bad
movi
on
these
day
just
to
ridicul
them
.
It
's
usual
a
fun
thing
to
do
along
with
the
rest
of
the
audienc
,
who
do
n't
seem
to
mind
particip
in
a
mass
``
Mysteri
Scienc
Theater
3000
''
-
type
view
.
I
STILL
KNOW
WHAT
yOU
DID
LAST
SUMMER
,
howev
,
produc
sever
lengthi
uncomfort
silenc
from
the
audienc
,
underscor
how
bad
it
realli
is
.
If
it
were
n't
for
the
main
actress
'
reveal
wardrob
,
I
'd
have
had
a
veri
,
veri
hard
time
sit
through
this
lame
sequel
.
I
ca
n't
imagin
tri
to
watch
it
on
video
-LRB-
horror
film
seemtim
better
in
a
theater
becaus
they
reli
heavili
on
audienc
particip
-RRB-
and
would
n't
recommend
it
to
peopl
,
unless
they
re
horror
film
fanat
or
huge
fan
of
Hewitt
and
Brandi
.
I
read
on
a
websit
somewher
that
anoth
sequel
is
alreadi
in
the
work
.
What
a
depress
thought
.
Hewitt
appar
need
to
spend
more
time
on
TV
figur
out
how
to
act
.
Rate
R
,
this
film
contain
lot
of
violenc
,
sever
gori
scene
,
and
a
coupl
nubil
,
horni
teenag
--
though
the
sex
act
itself
is
alway
thwart
.
I
'd
say
this
is
unsuit
for
kid
,
but
teen
would
n't
have
a
problem
sit
through
it
,
especi
sinc
they
