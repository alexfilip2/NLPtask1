Base
on
the
book
by
author
Jame
Ellroy
,
L.A.
CONFIDENTIAL
is
probabl
one
of
the
best
piec
of
work
produc
by
Hollywood
in
recent
year
.
Togeth
with
director
Curti
Hanson
-LRB-
The
Hand
That
Rock
The
Cradl
,
The
River
Wild
-RRB-
whom
Ellroy
corrobor
close
throughout
the
shoot
of
the
film
,
result
in
a
movi
with
a
plot
and
and
script
so
tight
,
an
atom
would
have
to
squeez
itself
through
.
Set
in
the
50s
,
the
stori
revolv
around
3
policemen
of
vivid
person
.
Jack
Vincenn
-LRB-
Spacey
-RRB-
is
the
cop
who
is
more
concern
on
bust
with
fame
and
stardom
ala
Hollywood
style
,
concentr
heavili
on
work
which
will
attract
him
media
attent
.
There
is
also
the
young
hot-shot
rooki
,
Ed
Exley
-LRB-
Pearc
-RRB-
,
fresh
out
of
the
academi
and
all-out
to
carv
a
name
for
himself
in
the
footstep
of
his
legendari
cop
father
.
The
tough
and
unnerv
Bud
White
-LRB-
Crow
-RRB-
,
a
cop
who
believ
in
justic
,
the
swift
and
violent
way
.
3
policemen
,
distinct
in
their
charact
and
path
but
all
of
them
work
in
a
place
where
there
is
no
real
distinct
between
good
and
evil
.
When
his
partner
is
murder
on
the
day
of
his
resign
,
Bud
set
out
to
find
the
peopl
respons
but
unwit
delv
himself
into
someth
more
than
just
a
simpl
robberi
murder
.
Even
after
Exley
receiv
a
promot
for
his
work
on
the
murder
case
,
happen
began
to
link
itself
to
the
murder
.
The
3
eventu
reach
a
point
of
converg
when
what
actual
began
as
a
person
investig
turn
out
to
be
an
uncov
of
a
complex
web
of
organised-crim
in
Hollywood
.
The
last
time
I
rememb
a
film
so
clever
and
compel
was
when
I
watch
THE
USUAL
SUSPECTS
.
In
L.A.
CONFIDENTIAL
,
you
do
not
get
the
shock
and
clever
as
the
former
but
it
has
a
lot
more
of
`
stori
'
go
for
it
.
There
is
not
a
singl
moment
in
the
film
in
which
I
felt
was
slow
at
all
.
Surpris
,
though
Spacey
did
a
veri
convinc
job
as
the
street-wis
Vincenn
,
the
movi
was
carri
most
by
the
two
rather
`
unknown
'
,
Pearc
and
Crow
.
Pearc
's
Exley
is
cool
and
calcul
in
his
action
and
there
is
a
slight
hint
of
Val
Kilmer
in
his
appear
.
Crow
's
Bud
White
is
the
most
impress
of
all
;
head-strong
and
temperament
,
he
should
obtain
some
sort
of
recognit
for
his
work
here
.
Superb
acting.
,
wonder
storytel
and
one
of
the
best
climax
gunfight
ever
.
Easili
the
best
Hollywood
piec
for
1997
.
