THE
APOSTLE
``
I
'd
rather
die
today
and
go
to
heaven
than
live
to
be
a
hundr
and
go
to
hell
,
''
earnest
proclaim
the
Pentecost
preacher
.
With
that
line
come
from
a
fundamentalist
Christian
minist
,
Hollywood
has
taught
us
how
we
should
fill
in
the
rest
of
the
stori
.
He
will
be
turn
out
to
be
a
scoundrel
who
has
less
actual
belief
in
God
than
the
averag
American
,
and
all
of
his
preach
will
turn
out
to
be
a
cynic
ruse
to
extort
money
from
his
naiv
congreg
.
From
ELMER
GANTRi
on
,
we
have
learn
what
to
expect
when
the
movi
go
to
church
.
Well
,
think
again
,
for
THE
APOSTLE
,
which
Robert
Duval
has
want
to
make
for
over
a
decad
,
doe
not
take
the
usual
tack
of
smear
the
minist
,
and
by
implic
all
,
the
rest
of
organ
religion
.
Instead
it
give
us
a
high
devout
man
,
who
certain
has
his
foibl
,
but
with
an
absolut
dedic
to
his
ministri
and
his
God
.
And
arguabl
just
as
surpris
,
the
good-spirit
film
is
no
comedi
,
even
if
it
doe
have
humor
moment
.
Instead
of
leviti
the
pictur
take
a
touch
serious
approach
as
it
introduc
us
to
a
world
not
normal
seen
in
motion
pictur
.
When
in
the
privaci
of
his
attic
,
Robert
Duval
,
as
Texa
preacher
Euliss
``
Sonni
''
Dewey
,
argu
stern
with
his
Lord
,
the
scene
share
a
kinship
with
Emili
Watson
's
charact
cri
out
for
her
God
in
BREAKING
THE
WAVES
's
most
power
scene
.
The
bodi
of
the
stori
start
with
Sonni
's
come
upon
an
horrif
auto
accid
,
which
is
anoth
part
of
life
general
ignor
by
modern
screenwrit
.
With
his
well
worn
Bibl
in
hand
,
Sonni
leap
from
his
car
so
that
he
can
go
pray
over
and
with
the
accid
's
die
victim
.
The
scowl
polic
offic
order
him
to
go
away
,
and
,
after
he
has
tri
to
work
his
miracl
,
Sonni
leav
with
a
smile
in
the
confid
that
he
has
done
the
Lord
's
work
.
Robert
Duval
not
onli
give
a
move
and
realist
perform
sure
destin
to
receiv
an
Academi
Award
nomin
but
is
also
the
film
's
director
,
writer
,
execut
produc
,
and
chief
financi
.
Rare
has
a
movi
been
such
a
labor
of
love
.
With
a
white
suit
,
peach-color
shirt
and
tie
,
and
dark
sunglass
,
Sonni
look
as
much
like
a
rock
star
as
a
preacher
.
Duval
has
everi
movement
down
pat
.
Even
when
he
is
walk
down
the
street
,
the
ever
strut
Sonni
can
not
contain
his
energi
.
He
danc
and
clap
all
the
way
.
Sonni
's
church
have
more
black
member
than
white
mean
that
he
share
his
preach
duti
with
mani
deep-voic
black
orat
,
but
his
rhetor
is
alway
competit
.
``
I
may
be
on
the
devil
's
hit-list
,
but
I
'm
on
God
's
mail
list
,
''
he
shout
to
the
congreg
in
a
reviv
tent
.
And
they
lap
it
up
.
Peopl
jump
up
,
scream
,
``
Prais
the
Lord
!
''
and
mean
it
.
The
intens
of
their
share
religi
experi
is
palpabl
.
But
Sonni
is
no
saint
.
It
turn
out
that
he
has
a
wander
eye
,
which
anger
his
wife
Jessi
,
play
in
a
remark
control
perform
by
Farrah
Fawcett
.
Jessi
get
her
reveng
by
take
up
with
the
church
's
youth
minist
and
conniv
to
gain
control
over
Sonni
's
church
,
leav
him
unemploy
.
Sonni
,
let
his
temper
get
the
best
of
him
,
doe
someth
foolish
,
which
caus
him
to
have
to
leav
town
and
two
belov
kid
forev
.
The
bulk
of
the
film
occur
in
a
small
,
predomin
black
church
in
Louisiana
,
which
he
build
up
from
a
derelict
build
with
no
congreg
into
a
remodel
church
-LRB-
``
One
Way
Road
to
Heaven
:
Holi
Templ
''
-RRB-
with
an
enthusiast
flock
.
In
this
part
he
rebapt
himself
as
The
Apostl
E.F.
.
The
Apostl
is
a
hard
worker
will
to
take
on
ani
odd
job
necessari
to
obtain
the
fund
for
his
church
.
He
ask
his
member
to
tith
,
but
he
give
all
of
his
money
.
And
his
good
deed
extend
to
secret
donat
of
food
for
the
local
poor
folk
.
A
man
who
ca
n't
stand
to
be
still
,
he
tell
one
of
his
friend
,
``
I
quit
school
becaus
I
did
n't
like
recess
.
''
In
his
new
town
he
meet
Toosi
-LRB-
Miranda
Richardson
-RRB-
,
who
,
like
him
,
has
a
famili
that
she
has
n't
seen
in
a
while
.
His
romanc
with
the
separ
woman
,
like
the
rest
of
the
film
,
doe
n't
follow
the
standard
pattern
we
have
grown
to
expect
from
our
movi
.
Billi
Bob
Thornton
show
up
one
day
play
a
local
racist
and
general
troublemak
.
His
confront
with
The
Apostl
is
yet
anoth
of
show
's
mani
surpris
scene
,
again
break
mani
rule
and
concept
about
what
approach
deepli
religi
peopl
might
take
.
Although
it
probabl
could
n't
have
end
ani
other
way
,
the
movi
doe
wrap
thing
up
nice
.
And
do
n't
miss
the
sweet
epilogu
dure
the
film
's
close
credit
.
A
tour
de
forc
act
perform
by
Duval
and
a
surpris
and
unrel
dedic
script
make
for
an
outstand
and
move
film
.
THE
APOSTLE
run
a
littl
too
long
at
2:12
.
It
is
rate
PG-13
for
mild
profan
and
brief
violenc
and
would
be
fine
for
kid
eleven
and
up
.
