''
--
a
young
actor
peg
for
major
movi
stardom
.
Inherit
the
mantl
from
last
year
's
``
winner
,
''
Matthew
McConaughey
,
is
Matt
Damon
,
and
,
like
McConaughey
,
he
prove
to
be
more
than
just
a
fresh
young
face
,
as
evidenc
in
two
radic
differ
project
current
in
releas
--
John
Grisham
's
The
Rainmak
and
Good
Will
Hunt
.
Damon
has
his
first
major
star
role
,
a
la
McConaughey
,
in
a
John
Grisham
adapt
--
in
this
case
,
Franci
Ford
Coppola
's
take
on
The
Rainmak
.
Damon
play
wet-behind-the-ear
attorney
Rudi
Baylor
,
who
,
immedi
after
pass
the
bar
exam
,
find
himself
repres
the
mother
-LRB-
Mari
Kay
Place
-RRB-
of
a
termin
ill
young
man
-LRB-
John
Whitworth
-RRB-
in
a
big-leagu
suit
against
a
neglig
insur
compani
.
While
Rudi
's
-LRB-
and
the
film
's
-RRB-
main
concern
is
this
case
,
he
also
find
time
to
protect
a
young
wife
-LRB-
Clair
Dane
-RRB-
from
her
abus
husband
-LRB-
Melros
Placer
Andrew
Shue
,
in
a
merci
brief
role
-RRB-
.
Written
for
the
screen
and
direct
by
Coppola
,
The
Rainmak
is
the
best
Grisham
film
yet
most
becaus
it
doe
not
take
itself
too
serious
.
Coppola
's
most
notabl
--
and
effect
--
contribut
to
the
tried-and-tru
Grisham
formula
is
a
sens
of
humor
about
itself
,
which
larg
come
in
the
presenc
of
Danni
DeVito
-LRB-
as
Rudi
's
unlicens
co-counsel
-RRB-
and
Golden
Globe
nomine
Jon
Voight
-LRB-
as
the
insur
compani
's
hotshot
attorney
-RRB-
.
The
inclus
of
the
batter
wife
subplot
feel
rather
superflu
,
but
Dane
is
as
superb
as
alway
.
Then
,
of
cours
,
there
is
Damon
,
who
nice
juggl
the
weighti
-LRB-
the
insur
case
,
the
spousal
abus
-RRB-
and
the
humor
-LRB-
Rudi
's
often
comic
naivet
-RRB-
requir
of
his
role
without
miss
a
beat
.
As
good
as
he
is
in
The
Rainmak
,
Damon
showcas
the
depth
of
his
talent
in
Good
Will
Hunt
,
direct
by
Gus
Van
Sant
and
written
by
actor
Ben
Affleck
and
Damon
himself
.
Damon
play
the
titl
charact
,
Will
Hunt
,
a
troubl
young
construct
worker/janitor
at
MIT
who
also
happen
to
be
a
supergenius
.
In
an
attempt
to
steer
this
brilliant
young
mind
in
the
right
direct
,
an
MIT
math
professor
-LRB-
Stellan
Skarsgard
-RRB-
tap
his
old
colleg
friend
,
communiti
colleg
psychologist
Sean
McGuir
-LRB-
Robin
William
-RRB-
,
to
counsel
the
abras
,
standoffish
Will
and
tri
to
help
him
come
to
term
with
his
turbul
life
.
Good
Will
Hunt
is
the
touchy-fe
enterpris
it
plot
synopsi
suggest
,
but
to
simpli
dismiss
it
as
that
would
be
to
discount
the
true
emot
chord
Affleck
and
Damon
's
intellig
script
touch
.
Even
though
no
one
-LRB-
and
,
if
so
,
_
veri
_
few
peopl
-RRB-
can
direct
relat
to
Will
's
burden
of
superhuman
intellig
,
the
insecur
he
suffer
are
univers
.
The
materi
is
brought
to
life
by
the
terrif
ensembl
of
actor
.
William
deliv
a
nice
dramat
turn
;
Affleck
,
a
hot
up-and-com
actor
himself
-LRB-
Chase
Ami
-RRB-
,
turn
up
in
a
warm
and
charm
perform
as
Will
's
best
friend
;
and
the
ever-app
Minni
Driver
shine
as
Will
's
Harvard-school
love
interest
.
The
clear
standout
in
the
cast
,
though
,
is
Damon
,
who
brave
doe
not
soften
Will
's
prick
natur
but
has
such
a
natur
eas
with
the
audienc
that
it
is
hard
_
not
_
to
care
for
him
.
So
mani
name
come
and
go
with
the
fluctuat
of
the
Hollywood
hype
machin
,
but
base
on
his
impress
work
in
John
Grisham
's
The
Rainmak
and
especi
Good
Will
Hunt
,
it
is
a
safe
bet
that
Matt
Damon
is
one
name
we
will
be
hear
a
lot
more
of
in
the
year
to
come
.
