His

.
Truman
is
realli
suspici
now
.
It

even
wors
the

a
nurs
,
describ
an
elev
accid
in
the
build
where
he
saw
the
loung
.
``
It
's
best
not
to
think
about
it
,
''
she
say
,
tri
vain
to
chang
Truman
's
memori
.
Truman
becom
determin
to
see
who
or
what
is
behind
this
appar
elabor
hoax
at
his
expens
.
At
everi
turn
he
is
stop
by
an
amaz
coincid
that
just
happen
to
keep
him
in
his
own
littl
town
.
His
last
hope
is
to
quell
his
fear
of
the
ocean
and
sail
to
the
edg
of
the
world
.
you
know
by
now
that
Truman
's
life
is
the
subject
of
a
televis
program
.
His
action
are
``
real
''
but
everyth
els
is
care
script
,
from
the
death
of
his
father
to
the
choic
of
his
wife
.
Truman
is
determin
to
find
out
what
the
big
hoax
is
.
Meanwhil
,
Christof
,
the
all-se
creator
of
Truman
's
world
doe
his
best
to
keep
him
unawar
and
happi
.
It
's
sort
of
like
WESTWORLD
told
from
the
robot
'
point
of
view
,
or
JURASSIC
PARK
from
the
dinosaur
'
point
of
view
.
We
root
for
the
CAPTIVE
of
the
cage-world
.
Our
protagonist
is
count
on
``
chao
theori
''
to
help
him
escap
his
elabor
trap
.
The
stori
,
written
by
Andrew
Niccol
-LRB-
writer/director
of
GATTACA
-RRB-
,
introduc
some
interest
question
,
such
as
the
ethic
of
subject
a
person
to
this
type
of
life
,
or
the
psycholog
impact
of
learn
that
your
entir
life
has
all
been
fake
.
Although
these
question
came
to
mind
,
I
do
n't
think
the
film
itself
ask
them
.
It
certain
did
n't
address
them
or
tri
to
answer
them
.
I
was
particular
disappoint
that
the
film
did
n't
deal
more
with
the
trauma
of
learn
one
's
life
is
a
TV
show
.
Carrey
's
perform
at
the
end
show
a
smidgen
of
Truman
's
pain
,
but
I
almost
felt
that
he
got
over
it
too
easili
for
the
sake
of
the
film
's
pace
.
Earlier
in
the
movi
I
found
myself
wonder
if
it
would
be
better
for
Truman
to
find
out
the
truth
or
whether
I
should
root
for
him
to
be
well
.
The
two
seem
exclus
of
one
anoth
,
but
Weir
and
Niccol
did
n't
see
it
that
way
.
Perhap
it
's
not
fair
to
critic
a
movi
for
what
it
Is
n't
,
but
it
seem
like
there
were
some
miss
opportun
here
.
But
on
it
own
term
,
the
movi
is
well
made
.
Sight
,
sound
and
pace
are
all
handl
compet
.
Much
of
the
first
part
of
the
movi
IS
The
Truman
Show
.
The
scene
are
all
appar
shot
from
hidden
camera
,
with
snoot
and
obstruct
cover
the
corner
of
the
screen
.
One
hidden
camera
is
appar
in
his
car
radio
,
the
green
LED
number
obscur
the
lower
part
of
the
screen
.
The
music
is
well-chosen
and
score
.
The
film
open
with
what
sound
like
famili
drama
theme
music
,
when
Truman
's
world
is
still
beauti
and
perfect
.
When
the
movi
end
,
the
score
sound
more
like
a
frantic
,
driven
,
Tangerin
Dream
opus
,
while
still
keep
the
same
timbr
.
Philip
Glass
'
epic
music
-LRB-
from
POWAQQATSI
-RRB-
permeat
Truman
's
scene
of
suspicion
and
awaken
.
-LRB-
Glass
has
a
small
cameo
as
a
keyboardist
for
the
show
.
-RRB-
And
the
pace
of
the
stori
was
brisk
.
There
was
no
unnecessarili
long
setup
explain
the
concept
behind
The
Truman
Show
,
just
a
few
quick
titl
card
,
a
few
interview
,
and
then
right
into
the
show
,
and
the
movi
.
One
of
the
first
scene
is
of
the
studio
light
fall
;
there
was
no
token
scene
of
Truman
's
idyl
life
befor
it
fall
apart
,
becaus
it
was
n't
necessari
,
we
pick
up
the
stori
at
the
first
sign
of
troubl
,
and
no
sooner
.
There
's
also
no
point
in
the
movi
where
the
plot
slow
down
.
It
's
a
quick
,
straight
shot
to
the
movi
's
end
.
In
term
of
overal
qualiti
,
I
would
compar
THE
TRUMAN
SHOW
to
Niccol
's
GATTACA
.
Both
film
are
well
made
with
interest
stori
set
in
interest
world
.
But
neither
film
realli
felt
like
it
capit
on
all
the
great
idea
;
neither
film
``
click
''
and
becam
an
instant
classic
.
Nevertheless
,
I
look
forward
to
Niccol
's
next
film
,
whatev
it
may
be
.
