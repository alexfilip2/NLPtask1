The
most
amaz
thing
about
Paul
Cox
's
Innocenc
is
how
unlik
a
movi
it
is
.
I
mean
that
as
the
highest
compliment
.
If
most
studio
were
to
profil
an
elder
coupl
who
rekindl
a
40-year-old
romanc
,
I
'd
want
to
run
and
hide
.
The
sex
scene
would
be
handl
as
a
farc
,
produc
would
shed
20
year
off
the
charact
'
age
-LRB-
so
Susan
Sarandon
and
Harrison
Ford
could
star
-RRB-
and
true
love
would
shine
through
ani
obstacl
without
explan
and
consequ
.
Along
with
a
charm
romant
stori
,
the
Australian/Belgian
Innocenc
show
how
an
increas
sens
of
mortal
combin
with
revisit
the
past
while
be
entrench
in
the
present
can
make
someth
that
seem
so
right
seem
downright
question
.
The
romanc
get
start
when
former
musician
Andrea
-LRB-
Charl
``
Bud
''
Tingwel
-RRB-
,
learn
that
his
true
love
,
Clair
-LRB-
Julia
Blake
-RRB-
,
live
nearbi
.
They
decid
to
catch
up
on
old
time
,
but
soon
find
themselv
in
a
reinvigor
affair
.
Complic
matter
is
Andrea
'
frail
health
,
and
Clair
's
longtim
husband
-LRB-
Terri
Norri
-RRB-
,
who
ca
n't
understand
whi
he
's
sudden
becom
obsolet
.
In
my
mind
,
the
movi
is
less
about
the
relationship
between
Andrea
and
Clair
,
than
the
feel
of
everyon
involv
.
John
,
Clair
's
husband
,
endless
question
what
he
did
wrong
.
Clair
initi
insist
she
's
a
grown-up
,
but
admit
behav
like
a
child
,
a
prospect
that
thrill
and
disappoint
her
.
Andrea
,
an
agnost
,
begin
to
question
his
fate
,
a
messag
Cox
deliv
in
a
memor
dream
sequenc
.
Cox
litter
the
movi
with
flashback
,
includ
the
repeat
vision
of
a
roar
train
.
It
's
a
remind
of
Andrea
and
Clair
's
past
love
-LRB-
as
young
lover
,
they
met
by
train
-RRB-
,
but
as
it
recur
,
we
get
the
feel
that
the
past
and
the
present
have
clash
.
A
pall
is
cast
on
the
whole
affair
.
A
master
of
the
underst
,
Cox
string
togeth
a
seri
of
memor
moment
.
In
Andrea
'
dream
sequenc
,
amidst
the
roar
of
the
train
and
convers
,
we
get
the
whole
pictur
of
Andrea
and
Clair
's
love
.
We
also
get
glimps
into
John
and
Clair
's
relationship
.
Dure
a
silent
candlelit
dinner
short
afterward
,
Clair
admit
to
John
about
her
indiscret
,
tell
more
than
ani
monologu
could
.
All
that
's
heard
is
the
scrape
of
fork
against
plate
.
The
charact
are
unlik
anyth
I
ve
seen
--
they
re
peopl
.
So
mani
time
,
movi
and
especi
televis
portray
senior
citizen
as
grate
spunki
.
Or
they
re
reduc
to
comed
buffoon
.
Ordinari
peopl
with
a
pile
of
emot
,
Clair
and
Andrea
are
n't
sure
what
the
next
step
is
.
They
do
want
to
be
happi
,
which
consist
of
an
entir
differ
set
of
condit
than
what
they
ve
known
throughout
their
adult
live
.
Bravo
to
Cox
,
who
wrote
the
script
,
for
not
make
John
a
monster
,
so
that
Clair
's
affair
is
automat
justifi
.
Norri
is
so
effect
as
John
that
he
make
Andrea
and
Clair
's
love
difficult
to
accept
.
We
feel
for
him
.
He
's
a
decent
man
.
Sure
,
he
may
have
becom
complac
,
but
he
never
expect
this
,
especi
now
.
With
so
much
present
to
the
audienc
,
it
's
onli
expect
that
the
materi
get
a
littl
drawn
out
and
repetit
,
which
it
doe
.
Howev
,
in
bring
up
tough
question
and
not
offer
easi
answer
,
Cox
display
a
skill
and
lan
is
n't
like
to
be
surpass
by
anyon
anytim
soon
.
