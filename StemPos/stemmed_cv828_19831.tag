All
those
who
were
offend
by
There
's
Someth
About
Mari
should
not
tread
in
the
water
of
American
Pie
,
a
gratuit
sexual
rollercoast
ride
of
raunch
.
And
while
this
uproari
funni
,
gross-out
summer
movi
is
basic
an
exercis
in
bad
tast
,
it
also
demonstr
a
surpris
sweet
in
the
end
.
American
Pie
is
the
latest
entri
to
the
offens
teenage-target
fare
this
season
.
I
must
question
the
studio
that
releas
a
movi
like
this
.
The
produc
are
aim
these
film
at
the
15-24
crowd
,
but
while
push
the
limit
of
possibl
sex
and
violenc
in
an
R-rate
film
.
Some
have
even
been
narrowli
avoid
the
dread
NC-17
,
a
rate
the
MPAA
give
when
the
adult
content
surpass
even
that
of
a
Restrict
movi
.
American
Pie
was
threaten
with
an
NC-17
,
but
after
snip
a
few
scene
from
the
finish
product
,
it
was
given
an
R
.
But
at
least
this
new
addit
is
not
as
careless
and
unforgiv
as
someth
like
South
Park
.
It
is
sick
,
pervers
,
and
ultim
disgusting-not
to
mention
extrem
funni
.
American
Pie
is
about
four
desper
teenag
who
make
a
pact
to
lose
their
virgin
by
prom
night
.
Jim
-LRB-
Jason
Bigg
-RRB-
,
Kevin
-LRB-
Thoma
Ian
Nichola
-RRB-
,
Oz
-LRB-
Chris
Klein
-RRB-
and
Finch
-LRB-
Eddie
Kay
Thoma
-RRB-
are
a
quartet
of
high
school
student
in
their
senior
year
who
think
sex
is
someth
they
must
experi
to
be
success
in
their
live
ahead
.
Jim
inquir
what
it
feel
like
when
you
reach
third
base
,
to
which
one
of
his
friend
repli
:
`
Like
warm
appl
pie
...
'
.
Of
cours
,
this
prompt
the
scene
unfair
expos
in
the
trailer
,
in
which
Jim
and
a
fresh
bake
pie
have
a
veri
intim
moment
in
the
kitchen
corner
.
There
are
mani
moment
,
such
as
this
,
in
which
director
Paul
Weitz
use
a
game-plan
similar
to
the
one
frequent
display
in
Mari
:
to
caus
the
audienc
to
break
down
laugh
in
disgust
disbelief
.
American
Pie
is
a
hard-fought
effort
that
has
replenish
reward
if
you
manag
to
stick
with
it
.
I
love
the
young
cast
in
this
movi
.
Consid
the
subject
matter
that
these
actor
have
dealt
with
,
obvious
suggest
never
rival
in
ani
of
their
previous
project
,
and
you
should
appreci
their
perform
.
Bigg
is
more
than
enjoy
,
and
Chris
Klein
-LRB-
who
recent
play
a
similar
jock
in
Election
-RRB-
is
obvious
a
young
talent
on
the
rise
.
But
in
a
teen-domin
movi
,
the
best
perform
come
from
comedian
Eugen
Levi
-LRB-
of
televis
's
SCTV
-RRB-
,
who
is
unexpect
brilliant
as
Jim
's
uneasi
father
.
Scene
in
which
the
familiar
father-son
convers
are
brought
to
interest
new
level
are
the
funniest
moment
to
be
found
in
American
Pie
.
After
Levi
discov
Jim
's
new
use
for
appl
pie
,
he
tell
him
,
`
I
did
a
fare
share
of
that
sort
of
thing
when
I
was
your
age
.
But
I
never
use
bake
good
.
'
It
is
perform
such
as
his
,
and
Bill
Murray
's
in
Rushmor
,
that
are
often
unfair
dismiss
when
award
are
hand
out
.
There
are
some
less-than-origin
aspect
of
the
film
.
A
bathroom
incid
involv
Finch
and
a
bottl
of
Ex-Lax
is
someth
we
ve
seen
befor
.
If
Weitz
is
plan
to
take
after
the
Farrelli
brother
,
then
this
is
a
decid
unwis
move
:
the
same
prank
was
pull
in
the
brother
's
Dumb
and
Dumber
,
and
use
to
greater
effect
.
Second
,
the
charact
are
forc
into
a
half-heart
climax
that
seem
more
artifici
than
amus
.
But
at
one
point
,
in
which
we
discov
that
American
Pie
doe
have
a
heart
of
it
's
own
,
Bigg
ask
his
buddi
whi
he
's
go
through
so
much
pressur
for
someth
that
's
`
not
veri
import
anyway
.
'
And
so
we
realiz
that
while
the
film
is
express
about
a
subject
that
is
hard
appropri
,
it
still
manag
to
be
matur
.
In
it
's
own
way
.
