Probabl
the
most
popular
and
prais
film
of
all
time
,
turn
out
to
be
a
primit
and
predict
costum
drama
with
a
dose
of
social
critic
.
Everyon
know
about
the
greatest
and
most
famous
ship
disast
of
all
time
.
And
the
actual
catastroph
is
master
craft
by
director
Jame
Cameron
,
combin
visual-and
sound
effect
,
he
re-creat
the
frighten
atmospher
of
the
sink
ship
in
the
middl
of
nowher
.
I
like
veri
much
the
emot
and
brutal
contrast
between
the
first
and
the
third
class
.
While
their
cabin
is
slowli
fill
up
with
water
,
a
mother
is
tell
her
children
a
fairytail
--
''
.
.
and
they
live
happili
ever
after
.
.
''
.
And
then
the
ship
goe
down
and
the
few
survivor
are
left
alon
under
the
star
and
the
chill
air
.
Howev
,
the
actual
disast
is
happen
almost
at
the
end
of
the
movi
,
while
the
first
two
hour
are
just
beauti
set
and
bad
dialogu
.
In
the
present
day
,
the
RMS
Titan
is
explor
by
Brock
Lovett
-LRB-
Bill
Paxton
-RRB-
,
a
treasur
seeker
look
for
the
Coeur
de
la
Mer
diamond
,
lost
dure
the
sink
.
Somewher
insid
the
ship
,
Lovett
's
crew
discov
a
sketchbook
of
an
artist
long
dead
.
Here
,
in
the
shape
of
a
nude
young
ladi
,
is
a
window
into
the
distant
age
of
1912
.
Lovett
is
extrem
surpris
when
he
get
's
a
phone
call
from
Rose
Dawson
,
claim
that
she
is
a
model
.
She
is
immedi
helicopt
onto
the
vessel
,
and
she
get
the
first
glimps
of
the
fate
ship
in
80
year
.
As
the
memori
come
flood
back
,
she
onc
again
becom
Rose
DeWitt
Buket
-LRB-
Kate
Winslet
-RRB-
,
the
fianc
of
wealthi
Cal
Hockley
-LRB-
Billi
Zane
-RRB-
and
daughter
of
Ruth
DeWitt
Bukat
-LRB-
Franc
Fisher
-RRB-
.
On
board
there
are
rich
and
poor
,
everyon
trust
in
the
ship
's
design
-LRB-
Jonathan
Hyde
-RRB-
and
her
master
,
Captain
E.J.
Smith
-LRB-
Bernard
Hill
-RRB-
.
On
board
the
ship
,
Rose
,
unhappi
and
restless
meet
Jack
-LRB-
Leonardo
DiCaprio
-RRB-
-
a
young
American
artist
,
poor
,
brave
and
attract
.
A
love
stori
slowli
emerg
and
the
two
lover
must
not
onli
experi
the
differ
between
the
social
class
,
but
also
face
the
greatest
power
on
earth-death
.
Cameron
could
as
well
have
call
his
pictur
``
The
Never
end
Love
''
or
``
Love
at
First
Sight
''
,
as
he
concentr
all
his
energi
on
the
young
coupl
,
and
not
on
the
disast
itself
.
The
plot
is
anyth
but
origin
and
the
dialogu
sometim
resembl
a
televis
soap-opera
.
The
director
doe
n't
even
tri
to
overcom
his
empti
script
.
Becaus
of
it
primit
and
predict
plot
,
Titan
is
total
depend
on
the
visual
that
truli
are
breathtak
.
Russel
Carpent
's
rich
,
majest
and
incred
detail
cinematographi
is
certain
award-worthi
.
Everyth
from
art
direct
to
visual
and
sound
effect
are
a
top
notch
.
But
it
doe
n't
help
much
when
the
costum
are
more
convinc
than
the
actor
who
wear
them
.
The
actor
are
not
to
blame
,
becaus
their
charact
are
more
like
caricatur
,
in
other
words-fak
.
Jack
is
a
man
with
mani
talent
:
he
is
a
talent
artist
,
handsom
,
brave
,
honest
,
strong
,
funni
...
you
name
it
.
He
doe
n't
have
ani
dark
side
,
he
doe
n't
make
ani
mistak
,
that
for
a
second
would
make
him
human
.
Jack
is
perfect
,
but
he
is-poor
.
On
the
other
hand
we
have
Cal
.
He
is
a
bastard
that
treat
Rose
as
an
odalisqu
and
not
as
his
wife-to-b
.
He
lack
everyth
Jack
possess
,
but
he
is
--
rich
.
This
childish
contrast
between
the
social
class
is
one
of
those
thing
that
make
Titan
noth
more
than
a
mediocr
pictur
.
Cameron
know
precis
what
we
want
to
see
.
His
film
therefor
contain
certain
minimum
to
draw
an
audience-attract
actor
,
a
``
tragic
love
stori
''
,
beauti
visual
-LRB-
includ
expens
special
effect
-RRB-
,
a
dose
of
social
critic
,
a
fascin
histor
event
-LRB-
we
love
true
stori
-RRB-
and
last
,
but
not
least-an
incred
media
support
,
which
proclaim
an
averag
pictur
the
``
greatest
film
of
all
time
''
.
On
the
outsid
Titan
look
perfect
,
but
behind
that
sparkl
curtain
of
incred
visuals-i
emptiness-noth
to
think
about
.
The
main
weak
of
this
film
,
which
iron
becam
it
success
,
is
simplic
.
Cameron
enabl
our
basic
and
if
you
wish-primit
emot
:
love
,
hate
,
fear
and
helpless
.
Everyon
understand
the
power
of
love
and
the
threat
to
our
beauti
coupl
is
likewis
imaginable-a
sink
ship
.
Titan
is
a
typic
Hollywood
product
,
total
and
complet
depend
on
visual
perfect
to
hide
it
primit
plot
.
It
's
a
good
pictur
,
but
absolut
not
a
masterpiec
.
It
's
among
hundr
and
thousand
good
film
releas
everi
year
,
not
better
or
wors
than
the
averag
American
film
.
