It
's
been
a
long
time
sinc
Walt
Disney
has
deliv
us
a
classic
along
the
line
of
The
Littl
Mermaid
or
Beauti
and
the
Beast
.
Sure
,
there
have
been
delight
outing
like
last
year
Hercul
.
But
noth
entir
groundbreak
.
With
the
releas
of
the
studio
's
newest
featur
length
film
,
a
remak
of
Edgar
Rice
Burrough
's
creation
Tarzan
,
Disney
has
plung
into
new
water
with
both
matur
and
anim
techniqu
.
It
's
no
classic
,
but
this
new
Tarzan
repres
exact
what
a
famili
film
should
be
.
The
plot
is
loyal
to
the
origin
storylin
,
as
Tarzan
's
parent
are
forc
to
abandon
their
ship
which
has
caught
fire
,
and
find
shelter
in
the
jungl
of
Africa
.
But
,
they
are
kill
-LRB-
offscreen
-RRB-
by
the
snarl
cheetah
Sabor
,
leav
babi
Tarzan
alon
and
unharm
in
his
crib
.
Found
by
Kala
-LRB-
voic
with
effect
gentl
by
Glenn
Close
-RRB-
,
a
kindheart
mother
and
member
of
a
gorilla
pack
,
Tarzan
is
taken
into
the
primat
group
and
rais
as
one
of
their
own
.
We
follow
the
young
boy
through
the
year
,
as
he
partak
in
various
adventur
with
his
loud
mouth
gorilla
friend
Terk
-LRB-
a
veri
brash
but
funni
Rosi
O'Donnel
-RRB-
and
clumsi
eleph
Tantor
-LRB-
Wayn
Knight
-RRB-
.
Of
cours
,
in
ani
Disney
film
we
are
given
some
kind
of
goofi
sidekick
or
humor
chum
for
the
hero
.
In
Tarzan
,
these
charact
fill
that
space
rather
inconspicu
.
Gag
that
were
magnifi
in
other
famili
film
are
kept
quit
minor
here
.
Most
of
the
charact
are
amus
without
be
forc
.
As
Tarzan
grow
to
manhood
,
the
suspect
antagonist
stumbl
into
the
pictur
.
Here
,
the
notori
bad
guy
is
the
big
game
hunter
Clayton
-LRB-
Brian
Bless
-RRB-
,
who
's
accompani
a
hapless
professor
-LRB-
Nigel
Hawthorn
-RRB-
on
an
expedit
through
the
jungl
.
Of
cours
,
there
's
the
professor
's
daughter
,
Jane
-LRB-
nice
vocal
by
a
cheer
Minni
Driver
-RRB-
who
will
help
suppli
the
romant
quotient
of
the
movi
.
The
thing
that
blew
my
sock
off
about
this
version
of
Tarzan
is
the
stun
anim
.
Director
Chris
Buck
and
Kevin
Lima
have
appli
a
breathtak
3-D
element
to
the
movement
of
the
athlet
titl
charact
,
and
the
fast-pac
edit
is
absolut
a
marvel
.
As
Tarzan
carri
Jane
through
the
treetop
,
narrowli
escap
a
pack
of
nasti
baboon
,
he
slip
and
slide
like
a
daredevil
snow
boarder
or
star
surfer
ride
the
big
wave
.
your
eye
can
bare
keep
up
;
it
's
a
fantast
accomplish
.
The
subject
matter
here
is
also
a
notch
or
two
abov
anim
averag
.
There
are
import
question
rais
about
Tarzan
's
place
in
the
world
,
and
all
are
handl
except
well
by
the
screenwrit
.
There
is
no
shred
of
doubt
left
to
ponder
afterward
,
which
is
a
surpris
plus
that
I
was
n't
expect
to
find
here
.
Suffic
to
say
,
this
film
will
have
both
adult
and
children
thorough
entertain
.
The
grown-up
Tarzan
is
voic
by
Toni
Goldwyn
,
who
made
a
name
for
himself
as
the
`
big
mean
jerk
'
from
Ghost
.
Goldwyn
is
effect
play
someon
who
's
not
awar
of
his
world
's
danger
.
Glenn
Close
is
also
memor
as
his
gorilla
mother
,
and
Lanc
Henriksen
-LRB-
from
TV
's
Millennium
-RRB-
is
terrif
as
the
silverback
father
unsur
of
how
to
accept
the
presenc
of
a
human
child
.
As
the
movi
's
villain
,
there
is
noth
particular
special
or
catch
about
the
charact
of
Clayton
.
It
help
that
Brian
Bless
suppli
his
voic
with
game
enthusiasm
,
but
he
is
noth
compar
to
Jame
Wood
'
hilari
Hade
from
Hercul
.
A
burley
guy
with
a
big
gun
who
just
want
to
captur
the
gorilla
doe
not
quit
constitut
for
an
all-togeth
notic
screen
presenc
.
Still
,
this
is
one
great
thrill-rid
that
Disney
has
construct
.
I
never
expect
Rice
Burrough
's
work
to
be
transform
so
success
from
live
action
to
anim
,
nor
with
so
much
emot
depth
.
Parent
,
along
with
all
the
kiddi
,
are
go
to
find
much
to
like
in
Tarzan
.
