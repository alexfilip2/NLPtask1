The
uncompromis
nuditi
bare
throughout
Petric
Chereau
's
Intimaci
has
alreadi
garner
much
notorieti
,
but
it
's
in
the
nake
face
of
fearless
actor
Mark
Rylanc
-LRB-
Angel

-RRB-
and
Kerri
Fox
-LRB-
Welcom
To
Sarajevo
-RRB-
that
the
tender
ach
of
emot
reson
is
discov
.
With
sharp
,
intellig
eye
that
reflect
experi
and
matur
,
Rylanc
and
Fox
are
refresh
detach
from
the
fals
glamour
of
Hollywood
idol
.
Their
sex
scene
togeth
are
brace
in
their
raw
honesti
,
in
the
accept
of
flesh
and
messi
.
Less
appar
,
but
no
less
remark
,
are
the
astut
observ
of
behavior
reveal
through
those
carnal
beat
of
hast
and
hesit
,
often
without
a
singl
line
of
dialogu
.
Not
aim
for
the
spiritu

of
In
the
Realm
of
the
Sens
or
the

of
Crash
,
Chereau
keep
his
sexual
odyssey
firm
ground
in
term
of
straightforward
charact
develop
.
That
may
be
the
veri
reason
whi
Intimaci
seem
uner
impress
but
never
particular
signific
on
more
than
a
tactil
,
sensori
level
.
The
theme
of
human
isol
are
barren
and
obvious
,
a
scienc
project
devoid
of
ani
especi
groundbreak
hypothesi
.
Intimaci
doe
manag
to
stand
out
from
lesser

Shallow
though
it
might
sound
,
it
's
amaz
how
much
is
fill
in
through
an
inspir
cast
,
percept
camerawork
,
and
imagin
way
of
treat
the
love

.
Those
ingredi
are
too
assur
and
confid
to

dismiss
as
ice

especi
sinc
they
are
the

Adapt

Everi
Wednesday
,
Jay
-LRB-
Rylanc
-RRB-
and
Clair
-LRB-
Fox
-RRB-
meet
in
his
clutter
,
dank
apart
for
an
hour
or
two
of
sexual
releas
from
their
uninspir
live
.
He
's
been
head
bartend
at
a
posh
restaur
for
over
six
year
.
She
's
a
mysteri
to
him
but
her
glum
workaday
appear
reveal
a
similar
dissatisfact
.
They
re
both
marri
,
but
his
relationship
has
curdl
into
an
embitt
separ
.
As
the
week
draw
on
,
Jay
obsess
take
it
upon
himself
to
uncov
Clair
's
person
routin
.
In
his
attempt
to
gain
a
fuller
semblanc
of
who
she
is
,
he
open
wound
that
had
n't
exist
befor
by
single-hand
corrupt
the
fantasi
.
If
it
were
n't
for
a
few
unnecessari
subplot
involv
Jay
's
brother
and
his
bevi
of
disgruntl
co-work
,
this
minimalist
premis
might
be
describ
as
a
modern
fabl
on
the
peril
of
wish
fulfil
.
Chareau
's
restless
camera
-LRB-
onc
again
wield
by
superb
and
ever-attent
cinematograph
Eric
Gautier
-RRB-
is
less
appropri
here
than
in
his
famili
transit-ori
Those
Who
Love
Me
Can
Take
the
Train
.
The
scene
that
linger
are
the
still
one
where
Rylanc
and
Fox
separ
,
pensiv
attempt
to
carri
on
with
their
makeshift
household
routin
.
These
are
often
captur
in
linger
,
unblink
wide
shot
that
view
them
strand
amidst
their
drab
workplac
and
home
.
Separ
prove
haunt
in
a
melancholi
seri
of
intercut
shot
as
Rylanc
and
Fox
undress
on
opposit
side
of
the
room
,
crawl
across
the
floor
to
meet
in
the
center
.
Despit
be
as
restless
as
a
fli
dure
the
hyperact
restaur
scene
-LRB-
all
the
better
to
blend
in
with
a
hustl
crowd
of
gabbi
trendsett
-RRB-
,
you
'd
be
hard
press
to
find
a
singl
uninterest
imag
.
Intimaci
take
an
interest
in
it
sordid
world
of
the
lower-middl
class
,
with
lone
pub
and
busi
shop
street
--
it
also
understand
the
peopl
who
inhabit
those
space
,
view
them
with
sympathi
scrape
raw
.
An
evalu
would
be
incomplet
without
highlight
the
great
Timothi
Spall
-LRB-
the
robust
scene-steal
of
mani
a
Mike
Leigh
collabor
-RRB-
.
As
Clair
's
cuckold
husband
,
this
jocular
heavyweight
play
out
his
hand
of
bitter
pill
scene
with
the
unforc
menac
and
self-effac
embarrass
of
his
impos
bulk
.
Bang
in
his
eye
,
his
mouth
form
into
quizzic
pout
and
dri
smirk
,
he
may
seem
the
fool
in
his
barroom
encount
opposit
a
sarcast

gleam
Mark
Rylanc
-LRB-
whose
Jay
has
arriv
on
the
scene
look
to
stir
up
some
troubl
-RRB-
,
but
Spall
is
no
one
to
trifl
with
.
His
overreach
Best
Pal
demeanor
suggest
a
mind
abuzz
with
secret
passageway
of
guil
,
his
point
question
onli
nave
if
you
choos
not
to
read
into
their
crafti
insinu
.
In
his
unassum
way
,
Spall
's
care
etch
interpret
of
hostil
buri
under
a
mountain
of
surfac
proprieti
may
becom
one
of
the
most
crimin
underappreci
perform
of
the
year
,
but
mayb
also
one
of
the
best
.
He
's
that
good
