Three
thing
I
learn
from
``
Be
John
Malkovich
''
:
when
get
on
the
elev
for
your
first
day
of
work
on
the1/2th
floor
of
a
build
,
alway
bring
your
crowbar
;
do
n't
stand
in
the
way
of
your
wife
's
actual
as
a
man
;
and
,
whenev
enter
a
portal
into
the
mind
of
anoth
human
be
,
wear
old
cloth
,
becaus
,
hey
,
it
's
muddi
in
there
.
``
Be
John
Malkovich
''
is
the
most
origin
film
to
come
down
the
pike
in
a
veri
long
time
.
Wild
surrealist
,
yet
present
in
a
down-to-earth
,
funki
style
,
this
is
the
kind
of
movi
that
stick
in
your
head
.
After
savor
the
sheer
invent
of
the
storylin
,
you
roll
around
the
wealth
of
idea
contain
within
it
.
From
the
ethic
of
relationship
and
polit
of
immort
to
the
veri
natur
of
ident
itself
,
there
's
a
lot
to
think
about
here
.
Just
do
n't
forget
to
have
fun
.
Clear
,
all
parti
involv
in
the
make
of
the
film
certain
did
,
start
with
writer
Charl
Kaufman
.
``
I
wrote
`
Be
John
Malkovich
'
without
an
outlin
,
''
he
explain
in
the
press
note
,
``
blind
,
with
no
sens
of
direct
or
purpos
.
''
It
's
import
to
me
that
I
do
n't
have
a
map
befor
I
start
.
This
allow
me
to
surpris
myself
,
stay
engag
,
discov
thing
,
and
,
hope
,
allow
the
unconsci
to
surfac
.

Spike
Jonz
-LRB-
Mark
Wahlberg
's
na√Øv
buddi
in
``
Three
King
''
-RRB-
take
it
from
there
.
The
white-hot
director
of
the
Beasti
Boy
's
``
Sabotag
,
''
an
award-win
parodi
of
70s
TV
cop
show
,
as
well
as
numer
other
music
video
and
commerci
,
eschew
typic
MTV
flash
for
his
featur
film
debut
.
Jonz
wise
realiz
that
a
storylin
this
unusu
is
most
effect
present
in
a
low-key
style
.
His
flat
,
matter-of-fact
approach
work
perfect
.
And
then
there
's
the
cast
.
John
Cusack
play
control
freak
Craig
Schwartz
,
a
street
perform
who
period
get
deck
by
parent
object
to
his
remark
express
,
but
decid
erot
puppet
show
.
Over
the
year
,
his
marriag
to
obsess
pet
store
employe
Lott
-LRB-
Cameron
Diaz
-RRB-
has
devolv
.
Once
passion
lover
,
the
two
are
now
littl
more
than
courteous
roommat
.
Financi
strap
,
Craig
take
a
job
as
an
entry-level
file
clerk
at
LesterCorp
,
locat
on
the1/2th
floor
of
a
Manhattan
Build
.
Navig
around
Dr.
Lester
-LRB-
Orson
Bean
-RRB-
,
his
105
year-old
boss
and
Flori
-LRB-
Mari
Kay
Place
-RRB-
,
Lester
's
dotti
secretari
,
Craig
tri
to
settl
into
his
new
posit
,
but
two
thing
keep
him
distract
.
First
,
there
's
the
beauti
and
imperi
Maxin
-LRB-
Catherin
Keener
-RRB-
,
who
delight
in
torment
Craig
over
his
obvious
lust
for
her
.
And
then
there
's
the
hole
behind
the
file
cabinet
,
which
turn
out
to
be
a
portal
into
the
mind
of
actor
John
Malkovich
.
Craig
learn
that
anyon
who
enter
the
portal
get
whoosh
into
the
subconsci
of
Malkovich
,
where
they
can
experi
life
from
his
point
of
view
-LRB-
with
enough
concentr
,
you
can
even
influenc
his
action
-RRB-
.
Afterminut
,
the
visitor
get
eject
and
unceremoni
dump
in
a
ditch
on
the
side
of
the
New
Jersey
turnpik
.
By
the
way
,
if
you
re
concern
that
I
gave
away
too
much
of
the
plot
,
rest
assur
--
I
bare
scratch
the
surfac
.
One
of
the
most
satisfi
aspect
of
the
fabl
is
that
Kaufman
is
not
content
to
simpli
milk
laugh
from
his
bizarr
set-up
.
Instead
,
he
crawl
into
the
dark
premis
as
complet
as
Craig
crawl
into
Malkovich
,
rummag
around
and
toy
with
the
various
philosoph
implic
of
compromis
anoth
person
's
ident
.
He
also
examin
the
consequ
of
the
Malko-visit
to
Craig
,
Lott
,
Maxin
and
,
of
cours
,
John
Malkovich
himself
.
The
perform
are
superb
.
Malkovich
-LRB-
best
known
to
mainstream
audienc
for
his
work
in
``
Danger
Liaison
,
''
``
In
the
Line
of
Fire
,
''
and
as
head
psychopath
in
the
guilty-pleasur
``
Con
Air
''
-RRB-
tweak
his
own
imag
in
a
dandi
self-deprec
turn
.
Far
from
his
effet
,
vagu
reptilian
persona
,
this
Malkovich
is
just
anoth
schlub
,
drink
with
his
pal
and
tri
to
get
laid
-LRB-
incident
,
Charli
Sheen
also
play
himself
in
a
hilari
parodi
of
his
well-earn
bad
boy
reput
-RRB-
.
As
alway
,
John
Cusack
nail
his
part
,
handili
pull
viewer
along
even
as
Craig
's
action
becom
unconscion
.
The
big
surpris
come
from
Catherin
Keener
and
Cameron
Diaz
,
both
play
against
type
.
Kenner
,
usual
cast
in
ici
subordin
role
,
is
terrif
as
a
high
intellig
,
extrem
manipul
femm
fatal
.
Cameron
Diaz
,
bare
recogniz
under
a
mess
of
brown
,
cur
hair
,
shed
her
perpetu
sunni
smile
and
draw
big
laugh
as
a
woman
thrown
into
extrem
sexual
confus
after
take
a
ride
in
Malkovich
.
``
Be
John
Malkovich
''
stumbl
toward
the
end
,
as
Jonz
and
Kaufman
tri
too
hard
to
resolv
the
various
subplot
.
Addition
charact
and
increas
complex
explan
lead
to
a
clutter
final
.
Regardless
,
this
contemporari
``
Alice
in
Wonderland
''
is
a
real
treat
.
I
enjoy
watch
``
Be
John
Malkovich
,
''
but
onli
later
,
after
reflect
on
the
film
,
did
it
reson
fulli
hit
me
.
At
one
point
,
Craig
say
,
``
Do
you
know
what
a
metaphys
can
of
worm
this
portal
is
?
''
Truer
word
were
never
spoken
.
