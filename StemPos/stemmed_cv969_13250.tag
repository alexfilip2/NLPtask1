''
as
the

of
a

beg
the
question
,
did

``
Out

is
not
like
to
secur
Ms.
Allen
the
kind
of
plaudit
bestow
upon
Pam

return
from
out
of
obscur
to
appear
in
anoth
recent
Elmore
Leonard
adapt
,
``

it
is
intrigu
to
see

With
the
success
of
``
Get

''
three
year
ago
,
filmmak
have
realiz
that
adapt
an
Elmore
Leonard
novel
can
be
an
easier
proposit
than
tri
to
dream
up
a
storylin
from

.
In
``
Out

Clooney
star
as

There
's
a
brief
struggl
and
Jack
bundl
himself
and
Karen
into
the
trunk
of
the
getaway
car
.
It
's
in

Allen
make
her

Clooney
's
rang
as
an
actor
is
limit
,
but
he
has
undeni
charm
.
Lopez
,
too
,
is
easi
on
the
eye
,
but
she
demonstr
more
depth
in
her
portray
of
Karen
,
a
tough

She

Not

clever
as
``

,
''
perhap
,
or
as
complex
and
color
as
``

load
