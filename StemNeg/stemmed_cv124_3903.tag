``
Someth
is
fishi
in
the
state
of
Univers
.
''
About
ten
year
back
,
with
the
unexpect
success
of
MAD
MAX
and
THE
ROAD
WARRIOR
,
post-apocalyps
nitty-gritti
surviv
yarn
becam
popular
at
the
movi
.
We
ve
alway
had
movi
of
this
natur
;
ON
THE
BEACH
,
THE
END
OF
THE
WORLD
,
DAMNATION
ALLEi
,
THE
ULTIMATE
WARRIOR
,
and
so
on
.
To
date
,
the
most
smooth
done
were
straightforward
``
haircut
''
of
the
classic
western
plot
,
like
the
lone
gunman
who
come
to
town
and
protect
the
widow
and
the
son
against
an
evil
organ
,
usual
one
in
possess
of
some
critic
resourc
,
like
water
,
feed
rang
,
or
a
mine
claim
.
Most
of
these
grew
out
of
vener
,
but
solid
hero
yarn
like
THE
VIRGINIAN
and
SHANE
.
-LRB-
My
person
favorit
is
a
Patrick
Swayz
movi
call
STEEL
DAWN
,
which
was
fair
well
made
on
a
small
budget
.
-RRB-
Now
we
have
WATERWORLD
,
which
again
bring
the
tradit
lone
gunman
to
town
to
rescu
the
young
widow
and
her
daughter
.
-LRB-
Well
,
she
's
not
a
widow
,
and
the
kid
is
n't
her
daughter
,
but
you
get
the
idea
.
-RRB-
The
ladi
is
Helen
,
play
by
the
stun
Jean
Tripplehorn
,
who
is
n't
given
a
chanc
to
be
stun
,
or
even
interest
,
by
the
mediocr
and
unimagin
script
.
The
child
Enola
,
play
by
Tina
Majorino
,
is
live
proof
that
a
child
actor
need
not
be
a
bad
thing
to
have
in
a
movi
;
she
outshin
her
materi
all
the
way
through
.
In
simpl
,
the
scene
is
Earth
,
hundr
of
year
from
now
.
The
polar
ice
cap
have
melt
,
and
somehow
produc
enough
water
to
inund
the
entir
planet
.
The
few
remain
peopl
live
in
boat
and
float
coloni
,
and
surviv
by
trade
,
theft
,
or
piraci
.
Somehow
an
oil
tanker
has
surviv
the
centuri
,
and
it
inhabit
,
call
``
Smoker
,
''
are
abl
to
keep
gasolin
engin
run
despit
the
dearth
of
replac
part
and
raw
materi
,
so
the
Bad
Guy
have
outboard
engin
,
and
fast-mov
boat
,
airplan
,
and
jet
ski
.
Enola
,
found
at
sea
as
a
young
girl
,
has
a
mysteri
map
no
one
can
read
tattoo
on
her
back
.
We
suspect
earli
on
that
it
is
the
way
to
the
mythic
``
Dryland
,
''
the
place
where
tree
,
crop
,
and
anim
grow
,
and
what
plot
there
is
hing
on
Who
Has
Enola
.
The
psycho
ruler
of
the
Smoker
,
the
``
Deacon
,
''
is
tri
to
get
her
and
find
his
way
to
Dryland
.
Play
with
typic
self-lampoon
,
rug-chew
histrion
by
Denni
Hopper
,
``
Deacon
''
is
the
onli
thing
in
the
movi
that
's
close
to
amus
.
His
perform
is
almost
laughabl
,
but
there
just
is
n't
enough
there
to
be
funni
.
The
star
-LRB-
and
a
co-produc
-RRB-
is
Kevin
Costner
.
He
's
play
an
un-nam
lone
denizen
of
the
sea
,
a
man
call
the
``
marin
,
''
who
turn
out
to
be
a
gill
,
water-breath
mutant
with
web
feet
.
Veri
littl
is
done
with
this
.
The
script
ignor
the
ineffectu
of
gill
in
suppli
enough
oxygen
to
support
a
human
metabol
;
it
ignor
the
fact
that
even
with
both
ice
cap
complet
melt
,
much
of
the
Earth
's
surfac
would
still
be
abov
water
;
and
it
ignor
the
blatant
imposs
of
the
cultur
and
technolog
shown
.
-LRB-
Can
meat
doe
not
last
for
centuri
;
ammunit
doe
not
fire
after
it
's
more
than
a
few
decad
old
;
and
so
on
,
and
so
on
...
-RRB-
I
'm
quit
fond
of
Tina
Majorino
's
previous
work
,
veri
impress
by
Jean
Tripplehorn
's
past
accomplish
,
and
still
speechless
over
Costner
's
DANCES
WITH
WOLVES
.
But
this
movi
could
destroy
the
career
of
anyon
associ
with
it
!
This
movi
cost
ONE
HUNDRED
AND
EIGHTy-TWO
MILLION
DOLLARS
,
and
there
's
noth
in
it
we
have
n't
seen
befor
,
done
better
on
onli
a
few
percent
of
the
cost
of
this
turkey
.
At
125
minut
of
materi
,
this
movi
cost
over
ONE
POINT
FOUR
MILLION
DOLLARS
PER
MINUTE
to
make
.
The
budget
of
this
movi
could
have
given
us
over
THIRTi
movi
;
it
could
have
paid
for
SIX
yEARS
OF
A
PRIME-TIME
SF
TV
SERIES
WITH
EXPENSIVE
FX
WORK
,
OR
TEN
yEARS
OF
AN
SF
TV
SERIES
WITH
GOOD
DIGITAL
FX
.
In
sum
,
this
movi
is
beneath
contempt
.
It
has
noth
new
to
offer
,
it
has
a
script
that
could
easili
have
been
better
by
the
peopl
who
write
comic
book
for
DC
,
and
it
spent
more
money
than
the
nation
budget
of
a
small
nation
.
If
you
have
to
go
see
it
,
see
it
on
a
four-dollar
matine
.
Otherwis
you
ll
find
yourself
sneer
at
you
everi
time
you
pass
a
reflect
surfac
,
for
week
.
