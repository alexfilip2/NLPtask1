When
I
initi
set
out
to
review
this
film
,
my
tag
line
was
go
to
be
``
you
too
can
believ
whale
can
fli
''
.
Then
it
was
go
to
be
``
you
too
can
believ
pastel
triangl
can
fli
''
.
THEN
,
it
was
go
to
be
``
you
too
can
believ
wood
sprite
can
fli
''
.
Final
,
I
just
gave
up
tri
to
come
up
with
a
tag
line
and
decid
to
say
...
there
's
a
lot
of
fli
go
on
in
this
film
!
As
our
first
host
Steve
Martin
tell
us
,
the
origin
concept
behind
Fantasia
was
to
bring
it
out
everi
year
with
some
old
segment
retain
and
some
new
segment
ad
in
.
Well
appar
that
plan
fell
by
the
waysid
for
a
while
,
becaus
approxim
sixti
year
have
pass
sinc
the
origin
classic
was
releas
.
Part
of
this
might
have
someth
to
do
with
the
cold
recept
the
film
got
when
it
was
first
releas
in
1940
-LRB-
gross
somewher
close
to
$
110,000
in
it
origin
month
of
releas
-RRB-
.
Subsequ
re-releas
of
the
film
have
elev
the
popular
of
the
film
to
the
classic
status
it
has
final
achiev
-LRB-
and
right
deserv
-RRB-
.
To
celebr
the
releas
of
an
updat
version
of
Fantasia
,
Disney
and
IMAX
team
up
to
present
the
anim
film
in
a
fashion
no
one
had
seen
befor
:
six
stori
high
.
In
an
exclus
four
month
engag
-LRB-
from
Januari
1st
to
April
30th
,
2000
-RRB-
,
Fantasia
2000
can
be
seen
at
mani
IMAX
theater
across
the
US
.
After
the
engag
is
over
,
the
film
will
be
shown
at
regular
theater
.
Is
the
format
effect
for
the
film
?
With
a
few
except
,
yes
.
The
first
segment
we
are
present
with
is
set
to
Beethoven
's
Fifth
Symphoni
.
It
's
hard
to
describ
exact
what
this
segment
is
about
,
but
it
involv
a
bunch
of
bright
color
butterfli
look
triangl
flit
about
happili
.
Everyth
seem
to
be
go
great
for
these
littl
thing
until
the
ground
erupt
with
swarm
of
evil
,
black
bat-lik
triangl
that
attack
and
engulf
their
lighter
counterpart
.
Eventual
,
shaft
of
light
from
abov
help
drive
away
the
evil
bat-lik
thing
and
peac
return
to
the
butterfli
thing
.
Though
this
segment
is
n't
veri
stori
driven
,
some
of
the
imag
are
veri
visual
strong
,
especi
the
scene
in
which
the
dark
cloud
of
bat
thing
-LRB-
who
are
all
outlin
in
blood
red
color
-RRB-
begin
to
overtak
the
sky
.
The
next
segment
is
set
to
Ottorino
Respighi
's
``
The
Pine
of
Rome
''
.
In
this
segment
,
some
humpback
whale
swim
happili
through
the
ocean
and
eventu
emerg
from
the
water
and
fli
around
the
massiv
iceberg
that
pepper
the
oceanscap
.
A
whale
calf
get
into
a
scuffl
with
some
nearbi
bird
dure
the
flight
and
end
up
get
trap
in
a
giant
iceberg
he
smash
into
while
tri
to
avoid
the
bird
attack
.
He
is
final
save
-LRB-
by
anoth
liber
shaft
of
light
-RRB-
and
he
and
his
brethren
take
to
the
sky
and
fli
into
the
upper
atmospher
where
they
frolic
in
the
``
ocean
''
of
cloud
.
Again
,
visual
are
the
key
with
this
segment
,
especi
where
the
whale
are
involv
.
Report
the
whale
,
as
view
on
an
Imax
screen
in
certain
sequenc
,
are
shown
as
actual
size
.
The
CGI
whale
look
incred
life-lik
,
except
for
some
goog
cartoon
eye
drawn
onto
the
imag
.
One
especi
strike
imag
involv
the
giant
shadow
of
one
of
the
whale
be
cast
through
the
wall
of
an
iceberg
as
the
whale
calf
tri
to
find
a
way
out
to
it
parent
.
Absolut
beauti
stuff
.
The
third
segment
-LRB-
and
the
least
of
the
eight
segment
-RRB-
is
set
to
Georg
Gershwin
's
``
Rhapsodi
in
Blue
''
.
This
segment
is
design
as
a
tribut
to
acclaim
caricaturist
Al
Hirschfeld
,
and
intertwin
four
differ
stori
about
sad
soul
live
in
depress
era
New
york
.
There
's
a
construct
worker
who
dream
of
be
a
jazz
drummer
,
an
out-of-work
sad
sack
that
dream
of
have
a
job
,
a
young
girl
that
dream
of
spend
time
with
her
parent
instead
of
be
hustl
off
by
a
schoolmarm
,
and
a
nebbish
who
dream
of
be
free
from
his
overbear
wife
.
I
wo
n't
go
into
how
everyth
work
out
,
but
in
fine
Disney
tradit
there
is
a
happi
end
.
Unfortun
,
the
stori
drag
quit
a
bit
and
the
seem
out
of
place
within
the
hyper
realiti
of
the
rest
of
the
segment
.
Segment
four
is
set
to
Dmitri
Shostakovich
's
``
Piano
Concerto
No.
2
''
and
is
an
anim
version
of
Han
Christian
Andersen
's
``
The
Steadfast
Tin
Soldier
''
.
A
one
leg
toy
tin
soldier
fall
in
love
with
a
wind-up
clock
ballerina
-LRB-
whom
he
assum
is
also
one
leg
becaus
he
ca
n't
see
her
other
leg
extend
out
behind
her
-RRB-
,
much
to
the
dismay
of
an
evil
jack-in-the-box
jester
.
The
jester
knock
the
soldier
out
of
a
window
and
continu
pursu
the
ballerina
.
Littl
doe
the
jester
know
,
the
soldier
has
been
deposit
in
the
sewer
and
has
journey
through
the
pipelin
onli
to
be
swallow
by
a
fish
that
has
been
captur
and
sold
to
the
owner
of
the
set
of
tin
soldier
that
the
one
leg
one
come
from
.
The
soldier
eventu
save
the
day
and
get
the
girl
.
Although
the
end
has
been
alter
from
the
Andersen
stori
,
``
The
Steadfast
Tin
Soldier
''
is
decent
told
with
in
the
framework
of
a
seven
minut
short
.
Some
children
may
find
the
jester
to
be
a
littl
frighten
,
but
otherwis
the
segment
is
well
made
.
Segment
five
is
the
funniest
of
the
bunch
.
Set
to
Camill
Saint-Saen
``
The
Carniv
of
the
Animal
''
,
this
segment
featur
a
flamingo
tortur
his
fellow
flamingo
with
a
yo-yo
while
they
are
tri
to
perform
a
choreograph
danc
number
.
While
it
is
the
shortest
clip
of
the
group
and
a
throwback
to
the
allig
and
hippo
danc
in
the
first
Fantasia
,
it
is
still
well
accomplish
and
a
welcom
bit
of
comedi
.
Segment
six
is
the
onli
segment
to
be
repeat
from
the
origin
1940
Fantasia
,
and
it
's
the
one
that
peopl
rememb
most
,
``
The
Sorcer
's
Apprentic
''
.
The
stori
is
the
most
recogniz
,
so
the
draw
here
is
see
it
on
the
enorm
IMAX
screen
in
remast
stereo
.
Unfortun
,
the
segment
was
n't
made
to
be
present
on
larg
format
film
-LRB-
consid
it
was
shot
full
frame
-RRB-
and
exhibit
larg
amount
of
grain
.
There
were
at
least
two
occas
where
imag
were
veri
hard
to
make
out
due
to
the
excess
grain
.
Similar
problem
crop
up
on
modern
day
releas
when
project
on
screen
too
larg
for
the
imag
to
be
shown
accur
-LRB-
but
no
one
seem
to
notic
for
some
strang
reason
-RRB-
,
an
anomali
common
to
mani
18-plus
screen
theater
.
Segment
seven
is
set
to
Sir
Edward
Elgar
's
``
Pomp
and
Circumst
March
No.
1
''
and
is
the
onli
other
Fantasia
segment
to
featur
a
stock
Disney
charact
.
Donald
Duck
``
star
''
as
an
assist
to
Noah
,
whose
task
is
load
all
of
the
anim
onto
the
Ark.
.
Dure
the
load
,
Donald
and
his
wife
lose
sight
of
each
other
and
both
believ
that
the
other
one
did
n't
make
it
on
the
boat
.
They
are
constant
miss
each
other
due
to
comic
misadventur
main
involv
Donald
be
crush
by
anim
in
various
manner
.
Despit
the
slapstick
style
of
comedi
in
this
piec
,
it
display
more
emot
in
it
final
scene
than
mani
of
the
tear-jerk
foist
on
audienc
these
day
.
Power
stuff
.
Segment
eight
bring
a
whole
new
mean
to
the
clich√©
``
save
the
best
for
last
''
.
Set
to
Igor
Stravinski
's
``
The
Firebird
''
,
an
elk
awaken
a
forest
sprite
that
proceed
to
chang
the
winteri
landscap
into
a
beauti
springtim
landscap
.
Tree
bloom
and
flower
blossom
and
everyth
seem
to
be
go
well
until
the
sprite
becom
inquisit
about
a
larg
mountain
hous
a
strang
format
.
When
the
sprite
examin
the
format
,
it
awaken
and
becom
the
titular
firebird
.
In
a
stun
spectacl
,
the
firebird
rear
back
and
unleash
and
fire
storm
that
destroy
everyth
in
it
path
,
includ
everyth
that
the
sprite
has
work
to
creat
.
Some
amaz
anim
is
present
here
,
and
well
worth
the
ten
dollar
a
ticket
alon
-LRB-
although
brush
stroke
are
evid
in
one
scene
due
to
the
enlarg
of
the
film
-RRB-
.
The
host
segment
are
larg
-LRB-
no
pun
intend
-RRB-
throwaway
,
although
Steve
Martin
's
clip
is
pretti
funni
.
Be
sure
to
stay
through
the
credit
for
a
littl
more
humor
from
Martin
.
Penn
and
Teller
are
usual
funni
,
but
here
their
gag
seem
routin
and
therefor
uninterest
.
The
best
segment
come
from
,
of
all
peopl
,
Bett
Midler
,
who
get
to
tell
us
about
some
of
the
abandon
segment
that
never
made
it
off
of
the
draw
board
.
Piec
like
Flight
of
the
Bumblebe
,
a
take
on
the
Four
Horsemen
set
to
Wagner
's
``
Ride
of
the
Valkyri
''
,
and
a
strang
segment
prepar
in
the
40s
by
Salvador
Dali
that
never
was
shown
are
all
preview
here
and
teas
that
they
may
appear
in
futur
instal
.
For
fan
of
visual
stimul
or
classic
music
,
Fantasia
2000
is
a
perfect
way
to
spend
the
afternoon
.
The
film
is
also
decent
famili
entertain
and
contain
littl
to
no
objection
materi
.
As
I
mention
earlier
in
the
review
,
if
ten
dollar
seem
like
too
much
for
you
to
spend
on
this
film
,
fear
not
becaus
after
it
run
in
IMAX
theater
it
is
go
to
be
brought
out
in
regular
theater
.
I
must
stress
that
the
best
way
to
see
this
film
is
on
an
IMAX
screen
though
.
Then
you
too
can
believ
that
whales/triangl
things/sprit
can
fli
.
