The
central
premis
behind

When

is
forc
to
hire
a
Kit
Ramsey
look-alik
name
Jiff

take

,
but
when

great
thing

Certain
scene
are
so
precis
execut
,
perfect

that
are
absolut

No

Standout
includ
the
chase

And
just
tri
not

laugh
in
the
climact
kung-fu
sequenc
,
featur
Jiff
in
an
excerpt
from
anoth
Bowfing
classic
entitl
Fake
Purs
Ninja
.
While
the
entir
97-minut
of
Bowfing
is
n't
alway
on
target
,
individu
scene
may
have
you
roll
in
the
aisl
.
Master
comedi
director
Frank
Oz
-LRB-
Dirti
Rotten
Scoundrel
,
In
and
Out
-RRB-
,
who
has
never
made
a
bad
movi
,
ensur
a
qualiti
final
product
and
is
aid
immens
by
Martin
's
sharp-edg
script
.
Howev
,
the
real
on-screen
star
is
Eddie
Murphi
.
This
is
the
actor
's
finest
work
sinc
his
breakthrough
into
the
Hollywood
market
in
the
earli
80
's
.
Murphi
excel
at
everi
corner
,
not
onli
succeed
with
present
believ
paranoia
in
the
eye
of
Kit
Ramsey
,
but
in
creat
a
likabl
buffoon
in
Jiff
as
well
.
These
three
talent
comic
mind
have
squeez
everi
morsel
of
potenti
out
of
this
premis
,
and
the
reward
is
a
virtual
guarante
help
of
hearti
laugh
.
Steve
Martin
generat
the
power
behind
Bowfing
,
but
Murphi
fuel
it
.
This
is
a
summer-tim
comedi
that
,
unlik
someth
such
as
American
Pie
and
South
Park
,
doe
n't
break
ani
rule
.
But
it
's
still
just
as
uproari
,
or
perhap
even
more
side-split
than
anyth
we
ve
seen
this
season
.
The
support
cast
,
includ
Christin
Baranski
as
a
work-lov
actress
and
Jami
Kennedi
as
the
cameraman
,
all
perform
well
within
their
limit
.
The
onli
presenc
that
demand
real
attent
when
place
next
to
Martin
or
Murphi
is
the
beauti
Heather
Graham
,
as
the
young
film
star
who
has
plan
to
sleep
her
way
to
the
top
.
Graham
,
attempt
to
further
her
stardom
after
appear
as
the
new
Power
'
girl
in
AP2
,
display
a
cheer
but
naiv
persona
that
nice
correspond
with
the
wacki
of
the
screenplay
.
I
would
n't
be
caught
dead
buy
a
ticket
for
Chubbi
Rain
,
but
watch
how
it
all
came
about
is
certain
entertain
enough
.
