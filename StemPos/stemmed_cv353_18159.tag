With
the
abund
of
trite
,
recycl
movi
in
the
late
'
90s
,
there
is
a
tremend
demand
by
movi
lover
-LRB-
never
mind
movi
critic
-RRB-
for
movi
that
present
the
wide
film
audienc
with
someth
truli
origin
:
perhap
audaci
,
perhap
pure
themat
.
For
the
former
,
you
need
look
no
further
than
director
Tom
Tykwer
's
incred
German
thriller
Run
Lola
Run
,
a
movi
that
may
make
some
viewer
need
a
cool
off
period
afterward
.
Lola
,
a
contemporari
Goth-girl
with
blaze
red
hair
receiv
a
desper
phone
call
from
her
boyfriend
Manni
one
day
.
It
seem
that
becaus
she
was
late
deliv
someth
he
lost
a
bag
contain
a
hundr
thousand
Mark
,
and
if
he
doe
n't
deliv
a
hundr
thousand
mark
within
the
next
twenti
minut
,
he
will
be
kill
.
This
give
Lola
twenti
minut
to
come
up
with
100,000
mark
,
or
her
boyfriend
die
.
So
she
run
--
not
just
jog
,
sprint
--
in
hope
that
somehow
,
someway
,
she
ll
be
abl
to
obtain
the
money
and
save
a
life
.

From
there
,
as
critic
Steve
Rhode
describ
it
,
Run
Lola
Run
play
a
bit
like
``
Slide
Door
on
steroid
.
''
With
a
non-stop
techno
soundtrack
,
wierd
camerawork
,
all
kind
of
insan
zoom
and
a
truli
breakneck
pace
,
anyon
that
is
bore
with
Run
Lola
Run
has
to
be
smoke
someth
.
Indeed
,
the
movi
is
often
outrag
excit
,
as
well
as
bitter
iron
and
subt
serious
.
Veri
much
like
Titan
,
Run
Lola
Run
is
an
achiev
with
filmmak
much
more
than
it
is
an
achiev
in
film
.
The
way
the
movi
is
made
,
for
pure
visual
style
,
Tykwer
's
movi
is
breathtak
-LRB-
liter
,
sometim
-RRB-
.
Themat
it
doe
leav
someth
to
be
desir
;
it
toy
around
with
some
intrigu
idea
but
doe
occasion
seem
as
if
there
is
littl
substanc
behind
all
of
the
flash
.
While
you
are
watch
,
this
will
not
matter
.
Run
a
breezi
81
minut
,
this
is
one
movi
I
wish
was
longer
becaus
it
was
so
damn
good
while
it
last
.
It
is
the
equival
of
a
roller-coast
in
the
amount
of
thrill
and
fun
that
it
offer
.
