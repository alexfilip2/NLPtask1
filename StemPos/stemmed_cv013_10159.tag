Opinion
:
Make
a
fiction
movi
is
easier
than
make
one
about
real
life
.
In
fiction
,
one
invent
purpos
,
clear-cut
good
guy
and
bad
guy
,
put
the
fiction
charact
in
conflict
,
and
take
the
tale
to
it
excit
conclus
.
Real
life
,
howev
,
consist
of
long
stretch
of
boredom
with
a
few
dramat
moment
and
charact
who
stand
around
,
think
thought
and
do
noth
,
or
come
and
go
befor
event
are
resolv
.
Spielberg
give
us
a
visual
spici
and
histor
accur

Djimon
Hounsou
