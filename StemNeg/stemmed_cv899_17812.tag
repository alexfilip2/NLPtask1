In
Life
,
Eddie
Murphi
and
Martin
Lawrenc
play
two
young
men
wrong
convict
of
murder
and
sentenc
to
life
in
prison
.
After
about
an
hour
of
watch
this
movi
,
you
begin
to
realiz
how
their
charact
feel
.
Fortun
,
for
audienc
member
there
's
a
chanc
to
escap
the
nearest
exit
.
This
,
undoubt
,
is
Eddie
Murphi
's
worst
movi
and
that
's
an
accomplish
.
Rememb
The
Golden
Child
,
Harlem
Night
?
Compar
to
Life
,
they
look
like
Citizen
Kane
.
Life
is
long
,
predict
,
foul-mouth
and
onli
intermitt
funni
.
Its
100-minut
run
time
feel
like
100
year
.
Robert
Ramsey
and
Matthew
Stone
's
script
basic
consist
of
Murphi
and
Lawrenc
refer
to
everyon
around
them
as
``
motherf
...
s
''
or
``
n.
...
.
s.
''
you
lose
count
how
mani
time
both
those
obnoxi
,
offens
word
are
use
.
And
if
that
all
it
take
to
write
a
script
,
than
ani
illiter
jackass
can
sit
at
a
word
processor
and
compos
a
movi
.
But
,
like
Life
,
it
will
probabl
stink
.
To
be
honest
,
the
screen
audienc
surround
me
in
the
theater
yuck
it
up
.
But
these
were
the
same
peopl
who
howl
at
all
the
flatul
and
fat
joke
as
well
.
Life
is
as
sophist
as
a
belch
.
It
's
crude
and
stereotyp
.
year
ago
,
movi
stereotyp
portray
black
subservi
,
second-class
peopl
,
good
for
be
onli
maid
and
servant
.
For
the
most
part
,
the
lot
of
black
and
other
racial
group
have
improv
.
But
a
new
,
more
insidi
stereotyp
is
creep
into
movi
.
In
mani
recent
film
,
through
actor
such
as
Murphi
and
Chris
Tucker
,
black
are
present
as
fast-talk
,
conniv
,
scam
artist
or
hip-hop
,
gun-crazi
,
sex-craz
youth
.
Both
set
of
caricatur
are
demean
.
And
the
fault
doe
not
rest
with
the
actor
.
They
have
to
eat
,
too
.
It
is
with
the
peopl
who
write
the
script
,
the
studio
who
green-light
the
project
and
the
audienc
who
accept
these
portray
without
protest

Otherwis

Life
is
an
embarrass

a
blot
on
the
resum
of
those
associ
