The

And
so
on
.
What
happen
?
How
is
it
that
an
individu
screenplay
-LRB-
_
Rushmor
_
-RRB-
and
a
novel
-LRB-
_
Election
_
-RRB-
contain
so
mani
signific
plot
point
,
and
yet
both
film
were
probabl
not
even
awar
of
each
other
,
made
from
two
differ
studio
,
from
a
genr
-LRB-
the
high
school
geek
reveng
movi
-RRB-
that
had
n't
been
fulli
form
yet
?
Even
so
,
the
strength
of
_
Election
_
reli
upon
it
fantast
perform
from
Broderick
,
Witherspoon
,
and
newcom
Jessica
Campbel
,
as
Paul
's
anti-soci
sister
,
Tammi
.
Broderick
here
is
play
the
Mr.
Rooney
role
from
_
Ferri
Bueller
_
,
and
he
seem
to
be
have
the
most
fun
he
's
had
sinc
then
.
Witherspoon
is
a
revel
.
It
's
earli
in
the
year
,
it
's
a
comedi
,
and
teenag
have
littl
clout
,
but
for
my
money
,
Witherspoon
deserv
an
Oscar
nomin
.
And
onc
Campbel
's
charact
get
go
,
like
in
her
fantast
speech
in
the
gymnasium
,
then
you
re
won
over
.
One
thing
that
's
been
bother
me
sinc
I
ve
seen
it
.
There
is
an
extraordinari
amount
of
sexual
in
this
film
.
I
suppos
that
,
come
from
MTV
film
,
I
should
expect
no
less
...
but
the
film
start
off
light
and
airi
,
like
a
sitcom
.
As
the
screw
tighten
,
and
the
tension
mount
,
Alexand
Payn
decid
to
add
element
that
,
frank
,
distract
from
the
stori
.
It
is
bad
enough
that
Mr.
M
doe
n't
like
Traci
's
determin
to
win
at
all
cost
,
but
did
they
have
to
throw
in
the
student/teach
relationship
?
Even
so
,
there
's
no
logic
reason
whi
Mr.
M
has
an
affair
when
he
doe
.
There
's
a
lot
to
like
in
_
Election
_
,
but
the
plot
similar
to
_
Rushmor
_
,
and
the
tonal
nosed
it
take
as
it
get
explicit
sex-driven
,
mark
this
as
a
disappoint
.
