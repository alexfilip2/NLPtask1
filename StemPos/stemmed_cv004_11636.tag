Moviemak
is
a
lot
like
be
the
general
manag
of
an
NFL
team
in
the
post-salari
cap
era
--
you
ve
got
to
know
how
to
alloc
your
resourc
.
Everi
dollar
spent
on
a
free-ag
defens
tackl
is
one
less
dollar
than
you
can
spend
on
lineback
or
safeti
or
center
.
In
the
NFL
,
this
lead
to
team
like
the
Detroit
Lion
,
who
boast
a
superstar
run
back
with
a
huge
contract
,
but
can
onli
field
five
guy
name
Herb
to
block
for
him
.
In
the
movi
,
you
end
up
with
film
like
``
Spawn
''
,
with
a
huge
special-effect
budget
but
not
enough
money
to
hire
ani
recogniz
actor
.
Jacki
Chan
is
the
Barri
Sander
of
moviemak
.
He
spin
and
dart
across
the
screen
like
Sander
cut
back
through
the
defens
line
.
Watch
Jacki
in
Operat
Condor
as
he
drive
his
motorcycl
through
the
crowd
street
of
Madrid
,
flee
an
armada
of
pursuer
in
ident
black
compact
car
,
is
reminisc
of
Sander
run
for
daylight
with
the
Chicago
Bear
in
hot
pursuit
,
except
that
Sander
doe
n't
have
to
worri
about
rescu
runaway
babi
carriag
.
But
like
the
Lion
star
,
Jacki
doe
n't
have
anybodi
to
block
for
him
.
Almost
everi
cent
that
's
invest
in
a
Jacki
Chan
movi
goe
for
stunt
,
and
as
Chan
doe
his
own
stunt
,
the
rest
of
the
money
goe
to
pay
his
hospit
bill
.
This
leav
aboutc
to
pay
for
thing
like
director
-LRB-
Chan
direct
-RRB-
,
script
and
dub
and
support
charact
,
not
to
mention
the
hideous
titl
sequenc
.
This
also
explain
whi
the
movi
was
shot
in
odd
place
like
Morocco
and
Spain
.
-LRB-
Chan
's
first
releas
in
this
countri
,
``
Rumbl
in
the
Bronx
''
,
was
suppos
set
in
New
york
,
but
was
film
in
Vancouv
,
and
in
the
chase
scene
the
Canadian
Rocki
are
clear
visibl
.
-RRB-
Heck
,
Jacki
doe
n't
even
have
enough
money
for
a
haircut
,
look
like
,
much
less
a
person
hairstylist
.
In
Condor
,
Chan
play
the
same
charact
he
's
alway
play
,
himself
,
a
mixtur
of
Bruce
Lee
and
Tim
Allen
,
a
master
of
both
kung-fu
and
slapstick-fu
.
Jacki
is
sent
by
the
UN
to
retriev
a
cach
of
lost
Nazi
gold
in
the
North
African
desert
,
and
is
chase
by
a
hord
of
neo-Nazi
sympath
and
two
stereotyp
Arab
-LRB-
one
of
the
thing
I
like
about
Jacki
Chan
movi
:
no
polit
correct
-RRB-
.
He
is
join
by
three
women
,
who
have
littl
to
do
except
scream
,
``
Jacki
,
save
us
!
''
,
and
misus
firearm
.
The
villain
is
an
old
Nazi
whose
leg
were
broken
in
the
secret
base
so
that
he
has
to
be
carri
everywher
,
and
he
's
more
pathet
than
evil
.
En
rout
,
we
have
an
extend
motorcycl
chase
scene
,
a
hilari
fight
in
the
Moroccan
version
of
Motelwith
the
neo-Nazi
,
and
two
confront
with
savag
nativ
.
Once
at
the
secret
desert
base
,
there
is
a
long
chop-socki
sequenc
,
follow
by
the
film
's
centerpiec
,
a
wind-tunnel
fight
that
's
even
better
than
the
one
in
Face/Off
.
This
is
where
the
money
was
spent
,
on
well-choreograph
kung-fu
sequenc
,
on
giant
Kevlar
hamster
ball
,
on
smashed-up
crate
of
banana
,
and
on
scorpion
.
Ignore
the
gape
hole
in
the
plot
-LRB-
how
,
exact
,
if
the
villain
's
leg
were
broken
,
did
he
escap
from
the
secret
Nazi
base
,
and
whi
did
n't
he
take
the
key
with
him
?
-RRB-
.
Do
n't
worri
about
the
product
valu
,
or
what
,
exact
,
the
Japanes
girl
was
do
hitchhik
across
the
Sahara
.
Just
go
see
the
movi
.
Operat
Condor
has
pretent
of
be
a
``
Raider
of
the
Lost
Ark
''
knockoff
,
but
one
wonder
what
Jacki
could
do
with
the
Raider
franchis
block
for
him
--
with
a
Lawrenc
Kazdan
screenplay
,
a
John
William
score
,
Spielberg
direct
and
Georg
Luca
produc
,
Condor
might
be
an
A
+
movi
.
Howev
,
you
ve
got
to
go
with
what
you
ve
got
,
and
what
you
ve
got
in
Jacki
Chan
is
someth
special
--
a
talent
that
mainstream
Hollywood
should
,
could
,
and
ought
to
util
.
