When
I
first
heard
about
Scream
in
1996
,
I
was
told
that
it
was
a
spoof
of
horror
movi
.
From
the
master
of
the
horror
himself
,
Wes
Craven
,
it
ridicul
the
clich
of
the
genr
by
overemphas
them
,
by
make
the
teenag
do
what
they
know
they
re
not
suppos
to
do
when
a
serial
killer
is
stalk
them
-LRB-
do
n't
run
up
the
stair
when
you
can
easili
go
out
the
front
door
,
never
say
``
I
ll
be
right
back
,
''
etc.
-RRB-
.
When
I
first
heard
this
descript
,
I
figur
that
it
was
an
easi
way
out
of
make
a
bad
movi
.
How
hard
is
it
to
make
an
extrem
terribl
film
but
claim
it
is
actual
a
mockeri
of
other
bad
movi
.
Was
this
Wes
Craven
's
remedi
from
make
``
real
''
bad
movi
such
as
Vampir
in
Brooklyn
?
It
just
seem
cheap
to
me
.
Then
I
actual
saw
the
movi
and
the
first
twenti
minut
,
involv
Drew
Barrymor
and
a
nail-bit
intens
phone
convers
,
complet
chang
my
attitud
.
Scream
is
not
onli
a
clever
parodi
of
your
standard
horror
flick
,
it
's
also
a
pretti
scari
movi
.
If
you
ve
seen
a
million
of
these
kind
of
film
,
you
know
exact
what
is
go
to
happen
.
This
is
part
of
the
fun
of
watch
Scream
.
The
movi
remind
avid
horror
fan
how
similar
and
repetit
the
genr
is
and
it
also
remind
them
how
great
a
guilti
pleasur
it
can
be
to
watch
pointless
and
predict
violenc
to
innoc
,
attract
teenag
.
To
those
who
rare
see
these
type
of
movi
,
Scream
is
a
thrill
unpredict
ride
that
could
be
mistaken
as
a
serious
slasher
film
.
There
's
noth
wrong
with
that
misjudg
though
.
I
have
wit
viewer
from
both
side
of
the
audienc
,
the
newbi
to
horror
and
the
fanat
.
Their
opinion
on
the
film
were
so
differ
but
both
veri
posit
.
From
these
vari
review
,
I
am
convinc
that
Scream
has
not
onli
reviv
the
teen
horror
movi
and
the
normal
teen
romanc
movi
but
also
the
hilari
parodi
of
these
and
other
categori
.
Film
that
both
derid
and
celebr
genr
like
Galaxi
Quest
and
The
Big
Hit
would
not
have
exist
,
in
my
opinion
,
if
it
was
not
for
the
outstand
success
of
Scream
.
The
low-budget
1996
gem
may
,
alongsid
Pulp
Fiction
,
be
the
most
influenti
film
of
the
1990
's
.
This
influenc
may
exist
to
the
chagrin
of
some
moviego
who
despis
movi
like
Teach
Mrs.
Tingl
or
televis
program
such
as
Dawson
's
Creek
but
to
other
such
as
myself
,
we
congratul
the
movi
that
has
open
new
door
for
excel
young
actor
,
screenwrit
,
and
director
.
Scream
is
also
an
extrem
funni
movi
thank
to
it
quickly-pac
script
by
Kevin
Williamson
.
Within
the
film
are
charact
who
tell
other
charact
,
as
well
as
the
audienc
,
the
basic
rule
and
clich
of
a
horror
movi
.
Main
from
the
rant
of
Randi
-LRB-
Jami
Kennedi
-RRB-
and
Stu
-LRB-
Matthew
Lillard
-RRB-
,
we
are
remind
not
onli
of
the
obvious
and
hilari
rule
but
also
some
of
the
more
subtl
stereotyp
that
when
thought
over
are
most
true
as
well
-LRB-
the
virgin
alway
surviv
;
have
sex
and
you
re
dead
meat
-RRB-
.
Not
onli
are
we
treat
these
rule
on
a
plate
but
also
the
rule
are
referenc
to
a
number
of
differ
film
and
actor
.
The
script
feel
like
an
obsess
essay
from
a
colleg
film
geek
who
has
noth
better
to
do
but
find
everi
littl
blunder
from
everi
littl
film
for
his
own
self-satisfact
.
In
this
case
,
Williamson
find
these
error
for
the
audienc
's
satisfact
and
amus
.
I
hear
there
is
a
new
movi
come
out
call
Scari
Movi
which
is
a
spoof
of
Scream
,
which
is
a
spoof
of
scari
movi
.
I
will
certain
see
the
film
but
I
have
the
feel
that
this
parodi
will
be
more
obvious
ridicul
the
genr
rather
than
Scream
's
perfect
subtleti
.
Howev
my
last
gut
feel
about
this
stuff
,
Scream
,
was
dead
wrong
...
so
who
know
.
