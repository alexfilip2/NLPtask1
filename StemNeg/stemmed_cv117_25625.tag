What
would
you
do
if
no
one
could
see
you
?
Well
,
if
you
re
a
super
smart
bio-molecular
research
scientist
work
for
the
militari
,
you
'd
grope
a
co-work
and
rough-up
your
neighbor
from
across
the
street
.
That
's
right
.
Of
all
the
non-crimin
possibl
brought
about
by
render
oneself
invis
,
in
``
Hollow
Man
''
Kevin
Bacon
's
charact
opt
to
commit
sex
crime
.
Er
,
it
's
Kevin
Bacon
who
play
the
super
smart
militari
bio-molecular
research
scientist
?
Someth
sound
horribl
wrong
alreadi
.
But
this
is
a
Paul
Verhoeven
film
,
and
the
sleazepin
director
of
such
open-crotch
classic
as
``
Basic
Instinct
''
and
the
infam
``
Showgirl
''
never
let
a
littl
credibl
get
in
the
way
of
his
voyeurist
tendenc
which
,
when
you
come
right
down
to
it
,
is
all
this
film
is
about
.
``
Hollow
Man
''
featur
a
string
of
hapless
,
C-list
actor
-LRB-
among
them
Bacon
,
Elisabeth
Shue
,
Josh
Brolin
,
and
Kim
Dicken
-RRB-
in
a
grade-Z
plot
with
a
lot
of
special
effect
that
,
frank
,
do
n't
look
much
better
than
those
use
in
the
1933
version
of
``
The
Invisibl
Man
.
''
Oh
Bacon
glisten
when
he
get
wet
all
right
and
look
like
a
rather
fatti
side
of
cheap
flank
steak
when
he
's
attempt
reentri
but
otherwis
it
's
lot
of
``
thermal
''
shot
and
inanim
object
-LRB-
Elisabeth
Shue
includ
-RRB-
bob
around
without
ani
visibl
sign
of
support
.
Sinc
invis
,
onc
achiev
,
is
n't
much
of
an
effect
-LRB-
the
actor
spend
half
their
time
convers
with
nobodi
and
the
other
half
of
their
time
talk
to
each
other
--
it
amount
to
much
of
a
much
-RRB-
,
the
director
elect
to
wardrob
all
of
his
femal
protagonist
in
loosely-button
sweater
so
that
the
minut
Bacon
's
charact
get
invis
he
can
head
straight
for
them
.
It
's
as
if
that
fascin
concept
--
what
would
you
do
if
no
one
could
see
you
?
--
is
simpli
a
Verhoeven
ploy
to
show
some
skin
.
As
a
horror
film
,
``
Hollow
Man
''
is
unsophist
and
disturb
-LRB-
in
it
intent
,
not
it
achiev
-RRB-
and
not
worth
your
time
or
your
hard-earn
dollar
.
It
's
minor
Verhoeven
--
and
even
that
's
not
say
much
--
and
boy
is
it
hollow
.
