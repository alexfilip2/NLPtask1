The
yet-to-be-releas
KRIPPENDORF
'S
TRIBE
is
be
market
as
a
famili
comedi
,
but
buyer
bewar
.
This
movi
ca
n't
make
up
it
mind
.
Is
it
a
famili
comedi
with
vulgar
refer
to
both
the
male
and
femal
bodi
,
menstruat
,
circumcis
,
and
sex
that
would
make
ani
parent
squirm
at
the
thought
of
have
their
child
next
to
them
?
Or
is
it
an
adult
comedi
approach
with
such
immatur
that
onli
adolesc
will
appreci
the
effort
?
Either
way
,
``
unbalanc
''
is
the
word
to
stamp
on
this
hit
and
miss
and
miss
and
miss
effort
.
The
premis
is
catchy-Widow
anthropolog
professor
Jame
Krippendorf
-LRB-
Richard
Dreyfuss
-RRB-
has
spent
the
past
two
year
``
get
over
''
the
death
of
his
wife
,
neglect
key
research
and
squander
grant
money
on
person
live
expens
.
Now
it
's
time
to
show
what
he
's
achiev
in
those
two
year
,
and
he
has
absolut
noth
to
show
for
it
.
With
a
fabric
tale
of
studi
a
previous
undiscov
tribe
in
New
Guinea
,
Krippendorf
petit
for
new
fund
while
hide
the
fact
that
the
previous
$
100,000
grant
was
spent
on
trip
to
McDonald
's
.
But
when
his
``
discoveri
''
becom
the
latest
craze
among
colleagu
,
the
professor
find
he
must
do
more
than
talk
about
the
tribe-h
must
creat
it
.
With
the
aid
of
his
three
children
,
the
headstrong
teen
Shelli
-LRB-
Natasha
Lyonn
of
EVERyONE
SAyS
I
LOVE
yOU
-RRB-
,
the
slight
younger
Mickey
-LRB-
Gregori
Smith
-RRB-
,
and
the
nine-year-old
Edmund
-LRB-
Carl
Michael
Lindner
-RRB-
,
the
``
Shelmikedmu
''
tribe
-LRB-
name
from
the
first
half
of
each
child
's
name
-RRB-
is
born
,
and
video
quick
produc
in
Krippendorf
's
backyard
are
pass
off
as
stun
documentari
footag
of
the
newli
found
New
Guinea
tribe
.
Despit
the
professor
's
wish
,
the
buzz
surround
his
discoveri
onli
grow
,
due
in
greatest
part
to
Veronica
Micelli
-LRB-
Jenna
Elfman
-RRB-
,
an
over
vivaci
-LRB-
and
voluptu
-RRB-
anthropologist
who
barg
her
way
into
the
discoveri
and
basic
deem
herself
Krippendorf
's
main
assist
.
Hungri
for
recognit
,
Micelli
set
up
interview
,
lectur
,
etc.
in
an
effort
to
make
this
the
biggest
sociolog
event
in
histori
,
a
sure
fire
way
to
go
down
in
the
histori
book
.
Krippendorf
,
on
the
other
hand
,
is
see
himself
go
down
a
jail
cell
corridor
,
not
in
histori
book
,
and
with
each
new
lectur
,
he
must
come
up
with
someth
impress
to
unleash
about
the
tribe-m
habit
,
domest
structur
,
etc.
.
Thru
fumbl
improvis
,
and
often
some
quick
think
from
his
oldest
son
,
Krippendorf
make
it
thru
each
new
lectur
,
but
onli
creat
more
and
more
interest
in
the
high
uniqu
tribe
.
On
the
oppos
end
is
Krippendorf
's
arch
rival
,
Ruth
Allen
-LRB-
Lili
Tomlin
-RRB-
,
an
arrog
professor
whose
jealousi
drive
her
on
a
mission
to
disprov
the
exist
of
the
non-exist
tribe
.
It
's
a
cute
idea
,
and
approach
with
a
more
subtl
-LRB-
and
matur
-RRB-
style
,
KRIPPENDORF
'S
TRIBE
could
ve
been
a
real
winner
.
Sad
,
the
mostly-misfir
toilet
humor
,
over
comic
music
score
-LRB-
by
Bruce
Broughton
-RRB-
,
and
sugar
coat
sentiment
-LRB-
all
the
key
ingredi
of
a
``
famili
comedi
''
-RRB-
just
are
n't
the
right
tone
for
this
film
.
Cut
that
crap
out
,
add
some
razor
sharp
dialogu
and
witti
sociolog
percept
and
you
ve
got
a
good
start
.
At
the
state
it
's
in
now
,
you
ve
got
someth
along
the
line
of
MEDICINE
MAN
meet
MRS.
DOUBTFIRE
meet
DUMB
&
DUMBER
,
and
that
's
not
a
concoct
anyon
should
be
over
anxious
to
tri
.
The
overal
product
here
is
a
high
forgett
cup
of
``
averag
''
,
with
a
few
laugh-out-loud
moment
and
a
great
big
gap
in
between
them
.
Most
of
the
charact
are
surpris
two-dimension
,
and
the
onli
one
who
seem
to
exhibit
ani
real
act
effort
-LRB-
Lyonn
-RRB-
seem
to
go
great
unappreci
.
Director
Todd
Holland
has
gone
about
make
this
film
in
all
the
wrong
way
.
It
's
stuck
in
limbo
between
Disney
famili
fare
-LRB-
JUNGLEJUNGLE
-RRB-
and
potenti
hilari
adult
comedi
-LRB-
A
FISH
CALLED
WANDA
-RRB-
.
It
's
this
unbalanc
structur
that
realli
knock
it
down
a
grade
,
and
it
's
a
brutal
drop
.
A
strong
warn
to
parent
:
forget
the
impress
given
by
advertis
,
do
you
want
to
take
your
kid
to
a
film
that
has
a
woman
ask
a
man
if
he
find
her
attract
mere
becaus
she
's
hold
his
peni
?
yes
,
it
's
put
that
blunt
!
Just
be
warned-thi
is
mere
one
exampl
of
the
mani
shock
subject
to
be
brought
up
in
the
film
,
and
other
might
not
be
as
tame
.
