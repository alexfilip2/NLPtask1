ONEGIN
``
When
will
the

take
me

The
spoil
titl
charact
of
_
Onegin
_
-LRB-
pronounc
Oh-negg-in
-RRB-
is
wait
on
death
to
reliev
him
after
a
lifetim
of
rapaci
behaviour
.
Martha
Fienn
'
debut
featur
is
-LRB-
quit
liter
-RRB-
film
poetri
-LRB-
it
's
base
on
an
epic
Russian
poem
by
Alexand
Pushkin
-RRB-
,
a
profound
studi
of
regret
,
of
how
we
confus
shame
with
guilt
.
When
we
first
meet
Eugen
Onegin
-LRB-
Ralph
,
act
for
his
sister
;
anoth
brother
,
Magnus
,
compos
the
score
-RRB-
,
a
philand
aristocrat
from
St.
Petersburg
,
he
has
just
inherit
his
uncl
's
estat
.
With
plan
to
sell
it
,
Onegin
pay
a
summer
visit
to
the
manor
,
which
is
locat
in
an
underpopul
Russian
countrysid
,
and
not
long
into
the
trip
he
meet
a
neighbour
famili
of
blue
blood
.
Smitten
with
Olga
Larina
-LRB-
Headey
-RRB-
,
he
befriend
Olga
's
fianc
,
Vladimir
Lenski
-LRB-
Stephen
-RRB-
,
while
Olga
's
sister
,
Tatyana
-LRB-
Tyler
-RRB-
,
romantic
his
flippant
attitud
-LRB-
he
's
a
nineteenth
bad
boy
-RRB-
,
fall
for
Onegin
.
In
one
sweati
,
inki
torrent
of
passion
,
Tatyana
write
him
a
love
letter
.
He
is
at
least
intrigu
by
the
note
but
reject
her
affect
,
it
is
impli
,
becaus
he
can
.
Soon
after
,
tragedi
strike
,
and
Onegin
make
himself
scarc
.
When
we
catch
up
with
him
,
six
year
later
,
he
has
just
return
to
St.
Petersburg
,
where
at
a
grand
ball
he
discov
that
an
old
friend
-LRB-
Donovan
-RRB-
has
marri
a
more
woman
and
word
Tatyana
.
This
time
,
Onegin
find
her
irresist
.
What
is
most
amaz
about
Ralph
Fienn
'
perform
is
his
subtl
physic
transform
from
dash
snob
to
miser
grouch
.
Overwhelm
by
a
top
hat
,
the
Onegin
who
pine
for
Tatyana
seem
smaller
in
statur
than
the
one
who
brush
her
off
,
an
Ebeneez
Scroog
trap
in
Christma
past
.
The
actor
has
been
constrict
play
hero
for
too
long
now-ther
's
room
to
breath
in
a
role
that
's
made
up
of
shade
of
gray
like
``
Onegin
''
.
Petula
Clark
sang
of
a
univers
phenomenon
in
``
Park
Lot
''
:
``
you
do
n't
know
what
you
ve
got
til
it
's
gone
.
''
Onegin
's
about-fac
on
Tatyana
speak
for
those
of
us
-LRB-
read
:
most
of
us
-RRB-
who
need
confirm
that
someon
or
someth
is
want
by
other
befor
we
want
it
as
well
.
What
the
charact
feel
is
not
jealousi
but
remors
,
embarrass
,
even
,
at
have
let
her
go
.
Out
of
identif
we
feel
empathi
for
Onegin
,
a
callous
bastard
.
Tatyana
's
emot
echo
a
thousand
ditti
,
but
that
make
them
no
less
vital
.
She
chang
,
too
,
from
a
girl
in
crush
to
a
woman
with
divid
loyalti
.
Tyler
acquit
herself
surpris
well
among
her
UK
co-star
,
fill
in
sketchi
gap
by
express
base
sentiment
in
a
seri
of
wanton
stare
.
They
both
have
face
,
Mr.
Fienn
and
Ms.
Tyler
,
capabl
of
convey
archetyp
Russian
miseri
.
_
Onegin
_
could
have
ad
up
to
littl
more
than
a
distinguish
episod
of
``
Masterpiec
Theater
''
,
even
with
it
current
cast
of
thoroughbr
intact
,
were
Martha
Fienn
not
at
the
helm
.
An
MTV
background
-LRB-
she
cut
her
teeth
direct
rock
video
for
XTC
and
other
-RRB-
has
posit
influenc
her
sens
of
pace
-LRB-
though
,
thank
,
not
her
shot
lengths-no
spasmod
cut
here
-RRB-
;
at
just
over
100
minut
,
_
Onegin
_
click
along
like
a
brisk
walk
through
valley
of
despair
.
The
film
has
an
atyp
period
look
,
as
well
.
Absent
are
the
sumptuous
tablewar
and
antiqu
furnish
that
stand
in
for
plot
and
charact
in
those
drippi
Merchant
Ivori
product
.
The
set
are
almost
expressionist
bare
,
echo
the
loneli
of
the
protagonist
.
-LRB-
Cinematograph
Remi
Adafarasin
often
allow
space
to
engulf
them
;
I
'm
remind
the
climax
,
which
unfold
in
a
sea
of
white
.
-RRB-
Martha
Fienn
has
a
clear
command
of
cinema
,
and
her
spare
,
often
pain
human
visual
present
of
``
yevgeni
Onegin
''
is
arguabl
the
most
lucid
translat
of
Pushkin
's
difficult
text
yet
.
Ms.
Fienn
may
be
the
most
excit
femal
presenc
behind
a
camera
sinc
Jane
Campion
.
