For

In

she
want
to
travel
to
the
Fleet
Academi
to
becom
a

so
the

is
broken
up

But
there
's
temptat
await
both
of

--
Johnni

is
in

form
of
an

in

Person
rivalri
and
sexual
jealousi
carri
over
into
the
final
minut
,
when
an
impend
alien
menac
begin
make
good
on
it
threaten
presenc
and
obliter
part
of
South
America
,
kill
Johnni
's
parent
and
destroy
his
home
.
Our
weaken
,
lovesick
protagonist
is
given
new
reason
to
stick
around
the
Mobil
Infantri
,
and
is
dispatch
with
a
group
of
fellow
fighter
to
the
alien
'
home
planet
,
where
he
will
head
up
a
ground
assault
to
end
the
threat
for
good
.
But
the
enemi
is
far
smarter
,
more
diabol
and
numer
than
the
good
guy
give
them
credit
for
,
and
after
an
initi
wallop
,
they
must
re-examin
their
strategi
.
The
exposit
--
play
like
a
futurist
soap
opera
--
is
silli
,
but
awar
of
it
own
ridicul
enough
to
merit
more
smile
than
groan
.
Once
we
get
past
the
campi
charact
introduct
and
the
numer
-LRB-
but
never
bore
-RRB-
train
session
,
``
Starship
Trooper
''
realli
kick
into
high
gear
.
Its
last
half
is
all
gruesom
violent
action
--
a
furi
of
sever
limb
,
decapit
,
disembowel
,
brain
remov
,
explos
and
other
jolt-induc
that
are
realli
go
to
pleas
the
13-and
14-year-old
boy
lucki
enough
to
dodg
get
card
or
caught
on
their
way
into
this
deserv
R-rate
show
.
The
creatur
design
and
special
effect
are
amaz
as
expect
,
and
their
interact
with
the
human
actor
are
a
realist
,
imagin
high
point
.
It
's
nice
to
see
intergalact
beasti
that
are
n't
too
deriv
of
the
titular
menac
from
``
Alien
.
''
These
monster
are
appropri
terrifi
sight
,
especi
the
Arachnid
,
a
spider-scorpion-crab
combo
that
's
all
sharp
talon
and
even
sharper
leg
.
They
attack
in
pack
of
hundr
,
and
it
's
a
funni
,
scari
sight
to
see
these
bug
take
repeat
hit
and
still
crawl
,
jerk
and
struggl
toward
their
intend
victim
in
a
determin
,
gooey
mess
.
It
matter
not
that
they
actual
have
a
laughabl
master
plan
in
mind
-LRB-
ask
yourself
if
a
speci
like
this
seem
capabl
of
carri
out
such
a
plot
-RRB-
;
these
sequenc
of
insect
warfar
are
numer
,
bloodi
and
immens
satisfi
.
The
occasion
dramat
moment
--
one
cast
member
's
death
,
the
final
resolut
to
Johnni
's
love
triangl
--
are
botch
,
a
testament
to
how
``
Starship
Trooper
''
fail
to
creat
ani
strong
,
outstand
charact
.
These
bland
Ken-and-Barbi
archetyp
serv
the
stori
adequ
enough
to
keep
ani
distract
at
arm
's
length
,
but
restrain
the
film
from
achiev
a
higher
ground
a
la
``
Star
War
,
''
where
even
the
slightest
alien
had
definit
person
.
The
act
is
decent
-LRB-
but
never
spectacular
-RRB-
;
most
of
the
perform
hail
from
Aaron
Spell
territori
--
smallish
role
on
``
Bever
Hill
90210
''
and/or
``
Melros
Place
''
--
and
it
occasion
show
.
Van
Dien
,
for
exampl
,
is
limit
but
perfect
likeabl
.
In
smaller
part
are
the
afore-ment
Neil
Patrick
Harri
as
Johnni
's
best
friend
and
Jake
Busey
-LRB-
Gari
's
son
-RRB-
as
Johnni
's
sidekick
;
the
latter
excel
at
play
creep
-LRB-
see
``
The
Frighten
''
or
``
Contact
''
-RRB-
but
seem
off-kilt
as
a
second
banana
.
``
Starship
Trooper
''
is
base
on
the
novel
by
Robert
Heinlein
,
a
sci-fi
writer
who
has
n't
exact
seen
ani
recent
adapt
justic
done
to
ani
of
his
book
what
with
1994
's
howler
``
The
Puppet
Master
.
''
But
the
overal
familiar
to
the
``
Alien
''
trilog
--
and
the
promis
of
great
gob
of
gore
--
could
act
as
a
crowd-draw
.
Its
own
possibl
influenc
,
howev
,
might
well
work
against
it
when
the
franchis
continu
``
Alien
:
Resurrect
''
open
in
a
few
week
.
We
will
know
then
which
film
to
crown
as
the
best
summer
movi
of
the
fall
.
