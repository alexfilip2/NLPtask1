about
you
Reindeer

-RRB-
or
you
did
not
guess
the
end
becaus
it
is
so
outrag
stupid

Screw

suit
the
latter
descript

What
start
out
as
a
dumb
guilti
pleasur
which
should
be
fun
to
mock
with
a
group
of
friend
end
with
a
complex
final

Whoop
.
Screw
is
an
inan
Christma
Carol
gone
berserk
with
few
genuin
laugh
and
mani
act
embarrass
.
Norm
MacDonald
star
as
Willard
Filmor
,
a
hard
work
chauffeur
who
just
want
a
littl
respect
from
his
rich
,
old
,
insidi
boss
,
Miss
Crock
-LRB-
Elain
Stritch
-RRB-
.
When
he
overhear
her
plan
to
fire
him
on
Christma
day
,
Willard
is
convinc
by
his
best
friend
Rusti
-LRB-
Dave
Chapell
-RRB-
to
kidnap
Crock
's
belov
dog
and
hold
it
for
a
ransom
of
one
million
dollar
.
Too
excit
to
pay
ani
attent
,
the
hapless
loser
'
plan
goe
awri
when
the
dog
escap
and
return
home
.
Now
Crock
think
Willard
has
been
kidnap
and
the
two
friend
,
realiz
they
can
make
even
more
money
,
decid
to
stage
the
fake
kidnap
.
Of
cours
,
everyth
that
could
go
wrong
doe
.
The
first
forty-f
minut
of
Screw
is
harmless
entertainment-a
guilti
pleasur
that
should
be
enjoy
bad
.
But
the
convolut
script
eventu
build
into
a
disast
that
is
imposs
to
bear
.
The
more
idiot
these
charact
get
,
the
more
reckless
the
script
becom
.
At
one
point
,
I
want
to
get
out
of
my
seat
and
yell
at
these
charact
:
``
No
,
you
idiot
!
''
I
'm
not
just
talk
about
Willard
and
Rusti
,
who
were
extrem
annoy
,
I
'm
also
talk
about
the
cop
in
this
film
.
A
monkey
could
have
solv
this
case
within
an
hour
but
these
guy
-LRB-
head
by
Murder
One
's
Daniel
Benzali
-RRB-
were
just
too
clueless
to
forgiv
.
They
give
real
cop
bad
name
.
Also
poor
Danni
Devito
appar
doe
not
know
how
to
turn
down
a
role
these
day
.
Look
almost
ident
to
his
Penguin
in
Batman
:
Return
,
everi
time
he
appear
on
the
screen
I
had
to
shake
my
head
in
disbelief
.
He
just
did
n't
belong
in
this
movi
.
MacDonald
and
Chapell
are
veteran
at
these
kind
of
movi
but
Devito
made
the
film
much
wors
than
it
alreadi
was
,
gross
out
humor
is
certain
not
his
fort
.
If
you
re
a
fan
of
Norm
MacDonald
's
other
chaotic
comedi
,
Dirti
Work
,
you
might
actual
love
this
near-sequel
.
Otherwis
,
do
n't
get
screw
out
of
your
hard-earn
money
.
