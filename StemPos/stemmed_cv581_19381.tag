a

Kubrick
,
a
renown
perfectionist
,
report
held
his
cast
``
hostag
''
on
the
set
for
near
a
year
-RRB-
.
In
an
uncharacterist
maneuv
,
Kubrick
cast
two
big-nam
star
in
the
lead
role
,
name
real-lif
husband
and
wife
Tom
Cruis
and
Nicol
Kidman
.
They
play
Bill
and
Alice
Harford
,
a
volatil
coupl
who
,
dure
the
cours
of
a
coupl
night
,
ponder
the
valid
of
the
idea
that
a
husband
and
a
wife
must
be
faith
to
each
other
.
He
is
an
M.D.
,
she
's
unemploy
and
we
are
introduc
to
them
as
they
are
get
readi
to
go
to
a
fanci
parti
.
At
the
affair
,
they
are
both
proposit
and
both
near
succumb
to
the
temptat
to
play
around
with
someon
els
.
When
they
return
to
their
lavish
New
york
apart
Kidman
-LRB-
after
smoke
a
dash
of
weed
-RRB-
inquir
whether
her
husband
had
sex
with
two
model
who
approach
him
dure
the
night
.
He
-LRB-
truth
-RRB-
say
that
he
did
not
and
ask
what
happen
with
that
Hungarian
guy
she
was
danc
with
.
They
proceed
to
argu
until
Alice
tell
her
spous
a
lust
stori
:
evid
some
time
ago
,
she
had
a
thing
for
a
young
naval
offic
.
She
admit
that
she
was
readi
to
give
up
her
whole
futur
with
Bill
and
their
young
daughter
if
this
guy
want
her
even
for
one
night
.
Bill
is
jolt
by
Alice
's
stori
and
we
anticip
his
reaction
,
but
at
that
moment
he
get
a
phone
call
and
has
to
go
``
show
his
face
''
at
the
hous
of
a
just-deceas
patient
.
This
turn
out
to
be
the
begin
of
a
long
and
event
night
on
the
town
.
The
daughter
of
the
dead
patient
hit
on
him
but
he
wise
turn
her
down
.
He
almost
doe
the
dirti
deed
with
a
kind
hooker
who
approach
him
on
the
street
.
Then
,
through
a
seri
of
coincid
,
he
wind
up
at
a
gothic
mansion
where
a
ritualist
-LRB-
and
frank
,
creepi
-RRB-
orgi
take
place
,
with
costum
peopl
perform
various
public
sex
act
on
each
other
.
Erotic
dread
mount
as
Cruis
-LRB-
who
's
not
suppos
to
be
there
-RRB-
wonder
the
spacious
hall
watch
the
``
action
''
until
he
is
discov
to
be
an
outsid
.
Much
hoopla
has
been
rais
over
the
fact
that
Warner
Bros.
digit
edit
the
orgi
scene
.
With
the
help
of
a
comput
,
they
put
in
cloak
figur
to
block
some
of
the
actual
sex
act
-LRB-
they
can
still
be
seen
,
just
not
in
all
their
glori
-RRB-
in
order
to
avoid
the
dread
NC-17
rate
.
European
viewer
will
see
the
film
as
Kubrick
envis
it
.
Roger
Ebert
call
the
American
version
the
``
Austin
Power
version
,
''
and
mani
other
have
bash
the
alter
.
I
am
of
the
potenti
controversi
opinion
that
the
figur
onli
supplement
the
scene
's
mystic
atmospher
.
The
first
thing
one
notic
about
Eye
Wide
Shut
is
how
it
look
.
This
is
an
art
,
distinct
gorgeous
product
,
shot
in
dark
,
moodi
hue
and
featur
some
elabor
,
beauti
sceneri
.
From
the
giant
mansion
use
in
the
film
's
centerpiec
to
the
decor
at
the
Christma
parti
to
the
Harford
's
apart
,
this
film
is
alway
a
pleasur
to
look
at
.
To
boot
,
a
great
soundtrack
make
it
more
atmospher
still
.
At
the
core
,
behind
the
graphic
,
controversi
content
and
unapp
mood
,
this
is
a
good-natur
movi
that
emphas
the
import
of
fidel
.
It
look
at
sex
as
almost
perfunctori
by
portray
it
as
unnerv
rather
than
erot
.
It
's
someth
superfici
and
yet
someth
necessari
to
achiev
a
deeper
relationship
.
At
the
end
,
it
seem
,
Bill
's
eye
are
wide
open
to
the
special
kind
of
love
he
and
his
wife
have
for
each
other
,
more
meaning
than
anyth
he
could
ever
hope
to
find
on
the
street
of
New
york
.
Kubrick
elicit
wonder
perform
from
both
Cruis
and
Kidman
.
Tom
is
complet
convinc
as
Dr.
Harford
,
a
man
who
seem
guid
sole
by
destini
,
with
no
control
of
the
cours
his
life
will
take
.
Nicol
project
a
quiet
intens
as
the
jitteri
yet
aggress
wife
and
her
perform
is
stun
effect
:
she
's
head
for
an
Oscar
nod
.
The
movi
has
some
help
from
a
similar
strong
support
cast
,
at
the
head
of
which
is
director-cum-thespian
Sidney
Pollock
,
enigmat
and
articul
as
Harford
's
mysteri
friend
.
Eye
Wide
Shut
is
not
perfect
:
the
last
hour
could
have
use
a
slight
more
scissor-happi
editor
and
both
Cruis
and
Kidman
are
too
good-look
for
me
to
believ
that
either
would
have
a
veri
strong
temptat
to
philand
.
Still
,
this
is
an
import
work
from
a
great
director
,
and
while
it
may
not
be
on
par
with
some
of
Stanley
Kubrick
's
best
it
is
a
worthi
final
film
,
a
complex
explor
of
jealousi
and
faith
.
