This
is
an
adapt
of
H.
G.
Well
'
acclaim
novel
`
The
Invisibl
Man
'
.
The
actor
are
Kevin
Beacon
and
Elizabeth
Shue
.
The
director
is
Paul
Verhoven
.
That
,
plus
a
quick
demonstr
of
the
amaz
special
effect
in
the
trailer
,
should
be
enough
to
lure
us
into
the
theatr
.
The
problem
is
to
keep
us
there
.
I
ca
n't
imagin
anyon
who
would
like
to
see
this
movi
a
second
time
.
Work
on
a
top
secret
militari
project
,
Sebastian
Cain
-LRB-
Kevin
Beacon
-RRB-
--
an
eccentr
genius
,
that
call
himself
``
God
''
,
has
discov
the
secret
to
invis
.
The
first
two
face
are
complet
.
Now
,
it
is
time
for
``
the
next
logic
step
''
--
human
.
Cain
volunt
for
this
riski
experi
.
But
when
he
is
made
invis
,
someth
goe
wrong
.
While
his
ex-girlfriend
Linda
-LRB-
Elisabeth
Shue
-RRB-
desper
tri
to
find
someth
to
return
him
to
normal
,
he
learn
that
invis
is
more
of
a
prison
than
a
superpow
.
But
that
's
not
the
bad
thing
--
an
unexpect
side-effect
of
the
drug
send
him
careen
into
paranoid
megalomania
.
He
is
natur
given
a
coupl
of
modest
superpow
,
just
enough
for
him
to
surviv
immol
from
a
flame
thrower
and
an
explos
of
about
a
quart
of
nitroglycerin
.
Soon
everi
sens
of
decenc
is
forgotten
.
The
littl
intellig
that
was
left
disappear
as
Verhoven
loos
control
and
the
film
turn
into
an
Alien-rip-off
,
where
Cain
is
walk
like
a
half
finish
Termin
,
spook
,
scare
and
kill
everybodi
.
Though
it
's
base
on
a
novel
call
`
The
Invisibl
Man
'
,
the
titl
has
been
iron
chang
to
`
Hollow
Man
'
that
sum
up
the
film
veri
nice
.
This
is
a
veri
silli
product
.
Laughabl
,
actual
.
Apparent
Verhoven
's
imagin
doe
n't
stretch
too
far
.
For
him
the
onli
worthwhil
reason
to
becom
invis
is
so
you
can
case
the
girl
'
locker
room
undetect
.
It
is
this
primit
schoolboy
mental
that
eventu
kill
the
movi
.
Be
invis
,
give
you
the
opportun
to
be
who
you
are
,
to
do
what
you
want
without
be
influenc
by
societi
.
In
mani
way
it
give
you
an
illus
of
have
a
life
without
consequ
.
The
natur
of
man
and
his
place
in
societi
is
what
the
novel
is
truli
about
.
All
that
,
the
depth
and
true
horror
of
the
book
is
gone
and
onli
special
effect
make
you
remain
in
your
seat
.
Cain
doe
use
his
power
voyeurist
in
Hollow
Man
.
But
sinc
this
is
a
modern
,
in
other
word
a
dehuman
,
he
doe
n't
stop
there
.
He
becom
a
rapist
.
And
then
,
of
cours
,
a
murder
.
you
ll
start
wonder
whi
such
actor
as
Beacon
and
Shue
found
themselv
in
such
film
in
the
first
place
.
Shue
's
talent
is
bare
seen
,
Josh
Brolin
is
underus
and
the
rest
of
the
cast
suffer
most
for
the
lack
of
talent
.
Kevin
Beacon
is
the
onli
one
that
perform
grace
.
His
face
is
not
seen
for
the
most
part
of
the
film
,
and
the
onli
way
he
exist
is
as
a
disembodi
voic
.
There
are
time
when
his
presenc
actual
save
the
film
from
be
complet
embarrass
.
In
the
end
the
effect
are
the
onli
reason
to
see
this
film
in
the
first
place
.
Be
probabl
the
best
technic
achiev
sinc
``
Jurass
Park
''
,
they
are
absolut
amaz
.
We
observ
the
layer
of
skin
,
muscl
,
tissu
,
and
bone
be
peel
away
as
a
bodi
is
slowli
render
invis
.
We
see
a
beat
heart
,
inflat
lung
,
and
vein
puls
with
newly-pump
blood
.
There
are
a
coupl
of
invent
shot
with
smoke
,
fire
,
air
and
water
,
but
are
a
few
scene
like
that
worth
attend
a
movi
for
?
What
is
truli
disturb
is
that
with
a
great
book
,
talent
actor
and
a
grand
budget
,
this
could
have
been
so
much
more
.
Pretti
much
like
Jan
De
Bont
-LRB-
``
Twister
''
,
``
Haunt
''
-RRB-
,
Paul
Verhoven
has
never
made
anyth
extraordinari
.
He
was
respons
for
sever
good
film
-LRB-
``
Basic
Instinct
''
and
``
Starship
Trooper
-RRB-
''
and
some
incred
bad
film
-LRB-
``
Showgirl
''
,
``
Total
Recal
''
-RRB-
,
but
he
has
never
made
anyth
that
was
great
.
In
a
way
``
Hollow
Man
''
fit
perfect
in
this
collect
.
It
's
not
better
or
wors
than
Verhoven
's
averag
film
.
He
prove
onc
again
that
he
is
incap
of
handl
more
complex
issu
.
And
so
,
instead
of
depth
and
chill
,
Verhoven
insert
some
of
his
trademark
:
stupid
dialogu
,
and
lot
's
of
dull
action
with
blood
and
nake
bodi
.
He
even
throw
in
some
of
the
worst
of
film
clichs-th
slowli
advanc
firebal
,
the
villain
who
come
back
from
the
dead
,
etc
,
etc.-and
top
the
whole
thing
off
with
one
of
the
most
ridicul
end
of
the
year
-LRB-
you
ll
be
scream
``
NOOOOO
!
''
and
attempt
to
run
toward
the
exit
in
slow
motion
-RRB-
.
And
all
we
can
ask
is
whi
?
The
answer
is
simpl
.
Though
Hollywood
is
a
movi
produc
machin
,
the
busi
of
moviemak
has
to
be
about
someth
more
than
money
.
It
has
to
be
about
tell
stori
,
not
market
them
.
It
has
to
be
about
transport
us
to
a
differ
place
,
to
dazzl
us
with
magic
and
clever
.
To
make
us
care
,
to
make
us
think
and
feel
.
Verhoven
has
obvious
miss
that
point
and
this
film
is
a
proof
of
that
.
It
's
all
flesh
and
bone
,
but
no
soul
.
a
void
where
it
imagin
should
be
.
