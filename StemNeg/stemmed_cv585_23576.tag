The
ad
make
``
Hang
Up
''
seem
like
an
upbeat
comedi
about
a
rascal
father
and
his
three
daughter
.
Anyon
who
went
to
the
movi
expect
that
left
disappoint
.
All
of
the
movi
's
funni
scene
were
includ
in
the
ad
.
So
what
do
we
get
?
Eve
Mark
-LRB-
Meg
Ryan
-RRB-
just
put
her
father
Lou
Mozel
-LRB-
Walter
Matthau
-RRB-
into
a
hospit
.
Once
upon
a
time
,
Lou
was
a
Hollywood
screenwrit
who
collabor
with
his
now-estrang
wife
.
His
one
great
moment
in
life
was
write
a
film
for
John
Wayn
,
who
gave
him
a
giant
bullet-shap
trophi
.
Now
Lou
is
senil
and
deterior
rapid
.
Eve
tri
to
convinc
her
sister
Georgia
-LRB-
Dian
Keaton
-RRB-
and
Maddi
-LRB-
Lisa
Kudrow
-RRB-
that
their
father
is
die
and
need
them
.
Both
are
slow
to
show
concern
.
So
devot
Eve
stand
vigil
over
her
father
,
who
constant
ask
for
his
favorit
daughter
Georgia
,
while
run
her
own
busi
-LRB-
plan
special
event
-RRB-
and
care
for
her
son
-LRB-
Jess
Jame
-RRB-
.
-LRB-
Some
comic
relief
come
when
Maddi
also
drop
off
her
ail
St.
Bernard
for
Eve
to
care
for
.
-RRB-
The
tension
build
until
all
three
sister
are
final
in
one
room
at
one
of
Eve
's
event
where
Georgia
is
the
keynot
speaker
.
There
's
a
superfici
resembl
to
Shakespear
's
``
King
Lear
''
-LRB-
senil
king
with
three
daughter
:
one
devot
saint
and
two
selfish
bitch
-RRB-
,
but
the
materi
is
appar
drawn
from
life
.
Sister
screenwrit
Delia
and
Nora
Ephron
had
parent
who
were
a
success
Hollywood
write
team
.
Henri
and
Phoeb
Ephron
collabor
onscreenplay
,
includ
``
Desk
Set
''
and
``
There
's
No
Busi
Like
Show
Busi
.
''
-LRB-
Delia
's
novel
,
the
basi
for
the
film
,
is
dedic
to
Henri
-RRB-
.
Surpris
,
the
script
is
as
thin
as
an
anorex
's
wet
dream
.
The
virtu
of
a
semi-autobiograph
project
would
seem
to
be
the
wealth
of
materi
avail
.
yet
,
the
Ephron
provid
onli
the
barest
minimum
of
inform
about
their
charact
.
Also
,
the
space
they
inhabit
seem
artifici
.
Eve
live
in
a
hous
that
look
like
a
magazin
layout
;
no
matter
how
put-upon
she
is
,
we
ca
n't
feel
sorri
for
anyon
whose
hous
is
so
pristin
on
ani
given
day
.
Georgia
is
a
famous
magazin
editor
,
and
in
her
brief
scene
while
she
chat
on
a
cell
phone
with
Eve
seem
like
the
photo
spread
for
a
profil
.
When
we
first
meet
Maddi
,
she
's
fish
at
a
picturesqu
mountain
stream
.
I
expect
to
see
the
credit
``
Cinematographi
by
`
Vaniti
Fair
.
'
''
And
,
yes
,
Dian
Keaton
is
liter
old
enough
to
be
Lisa
Kudrow
's
mother
.
To
her
credit
,
though
,
she
look
young
enough
to
pull
it
off
.
The
one
redeem
aspect
of
``
Hang
Up
''
is
that
,
at
it
core
,
is
a
truth
about
sibl
.
There
's
alway
one
on
which
everyon
els
in
the
famili
reli
,
free
the
other
to
be
selfish
and
emot
distant
.
My
wife
is
the
reliabl
child
in
her
famili
;
for
better
or
wors
,
my
brother
has
the
role
in
mine
.
-LRB-
Be
selfish
and
emot
distant
may
not
be
fulfil
,
but
it
is
a
lot
less
work
-RRB-
.
If
you
have
noth
better
to
do
than
watch
this
movi
,
look
for
a
power
cameo
by
Clori
Leachman
as
the
sister
'
mother
Pat
.
In
a
devast
scene
,
Eve
discov
that
her
mother
doe
n't
love
her
.
Although
Leachman
is
best
known
for
comedi
like
``
young
Frankenstein
''
and
``
The
Mari
Tyler
Moor
Show
,
''
her
perform
here
remind
me
of
the
consider
dramat
talent
she
display
in
``
The
Last
Pictur
Show
.
''
Bottom
Line
:
Everyon
involv
has
live
in
Hollywood
so
long
they
do
n't
recogn
real
life
anymor
.
