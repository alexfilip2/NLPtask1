Howev
,
sinc
this
is
DEATH
WISH
MOVIE
,
we
know
that
sooner
or
later
someth
bad
is
go
to
happen
to
the
peopl
Kersey
care
for
.
This
time
Karen
's
teenag
daughter
die
of
a
crack
overdos
and
Kersey
is
forc
to
return
to
his
old
vigilant
way
.
Kersey
's
new
target
,
unlik
the
previous
movi
,
are
n't
the
ordinari
street
punk
but
rich
,
heavili
arm
and
well-connect
drug
dealer
.
Even
such
unstopp
kill
machin
like
Kersey
need
some
support
,
and
it
come
from
the
publish
Nathan
White
-LRB-
John
P.
Ryan
-RRB-
,
determin
to
aveng
the
drug-rel
death
of
his
own
daughter
.
White
's
plan
is
to
make
Kersey
kill
major
player
in
two
rival
drug
deal
organis
and
thus
instig
the
war
between
them
.
The
plan
begin
to
take
shape
,
but
Kersey
's
action
bring
attent
of
two
polic
detectives-Rein
-LRB-
Georg
Dickerson
-RRB-
and
Nozaki
-LRB-
Soon
Teck-Oh
-RRB-
.
Fourth
-LRB-
and
,
unfortun
,
not
the
final
-RRB-
instal
in
the
DEATH
WISH
seri
,
will
probabl
rememb
as
the
typic
movi
of
Cannon
Group
,
product
compani
respons
for
some
of
the
worst
cinemat
trash
of
the
last
decad
.
Howev
,
although
some
critic
might
argu
,
DEATH
WISH
4
:
THE
CRACKDOWN
repres
slight
improv
over
the
DEATH
WISH
3
.
Paul
Kersey
,
one
of
the
most
intrigu
-LRB-
and
potenti
controversi
-RRB-
charact
of
the
1970s
,
is
still
be
dumb
down
by
mediocr
script
,
and
Charl
Bronson
realli
doe
n't
feel
the
need
to
put
much
effort
in
his
act
.
Howev
,
the
hand
of
a
veteran
director
J.
Lee
Thompson
seem
more
capabl
of
Michael
Winner
's
and
the
action
scene
seem
slight
less
surreal
,
although
they
still
look
cheap
and
repetit
and
downright
bore
.
There
are
some
attempt
for
the
movi
to
have
a
plot
between
the
numer
scene
of
violenc
,
and
one
of
such
attempt
is
a
potenti
interest
plot
twist
at
the
end
.
The
script
even
tri
to
fake
some
social
conscienc
-LRB-
through
crimin
underus
Kay
Lenz
's
charact
-RRB-
and
predat
the
War
on
Drug
campaign
that
would
inspir
mani
Hollywood
product
in
next
few
year
.
There
are
even
some
half-heart
attempt
of
humour-both
intent
and
unintent
,
like
in
a
scene
where
Kersey
assassin
mob
figur
by
a
wine
bottle-but
the
qualiti
of
this
movi
is
still
far
away
from
Bronson
's
1970s
classic
.
