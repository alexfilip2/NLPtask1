Spine-chil
drama
from
horror
maestro
Stephen
King
,
featur
an
outstand
,
Oscar-win
perform
from
Kathi
Bate
.
Geez
,
French
and
Saunder
had
a
field
day
when
they
set
to
work
on
parodi
this
!
Sorri
,
non-British
reader
may
not
be
familiar
with
French
and
Saunders-mi
apolog
.
The
pair
are
British
comedienn
-LRB-
Jennif
Saunder
later
went
on
to
becom
Edina
Monsoon
in
``
Absolut
Fabul
''
-RRB-
,
who
did
a
seri
of
film
spoof
a
few
year
back
,
includ
ALIEN
,
THE
EXORCIST
and
MISERi
.
Needless
to
say
,
amidst
her
chucklesom
imperson
of
Kathi
Bate
-LRB-
the
resembl
was
quit
uncanni
!
-RRB-
,
Dawn
French
got
pretti
nasti
with
her
sledgehamm
when
in
reach
of
Jennif
Saunder
's
leg
!
But
despit
the
linger
memori
of
their
sketch
,
and
although
I
ve
now
seen
the
film
a
coupl
of
time
now
,
that
``
hobbl
''
scene
was
no
less
disturb
!
I
'm
still
left
scream
at
the
telli
in
revuls
!
That
may
be
the
most
memor
scene
,
but
it
's
certain
not
the
onli
worth
watch
.
Stephen
King
,
whose
film
and
TV
adapt
tend
to
vari
in
qualiti
,
strike
gold
with
this
simpl
yet
strike
compel
tale
.
It
's
a
nice
craft
psycholog
horror
,
which
effortless
succeed
in
draw
you
into
the
plight
of
writer
Phil
Sheldon
-LRB-
Jame
Caan
-RRB-
.
Rescu
from
a
car
accid
by
Annie
Wilk
-LRB-
Bate
-RRB-
,
who
introduc
herself
as
the
writer
's
``
number
one
fan
''
,
he
soon
becom
her
prison
.
Both
the
script
and
Kathi
Bate
'
beauti
master
perform
-LRB-
for
which
she
won
an
Oscar
-RRB-
work
arm-in-arm
as
we
quick
begin
to
realis
that
beyond
her
bubbl
exterior
the
woman
is
basic
as
nutti
as
a
fruit-cak
-LRB-
or
is
that
fruiti
as
a
nut-cak
?
-RRB-
.
Bate
relish
her
demand
role
,
and
her
perform
is
noth
short
of
a
masterpiec
.
At
time
she
seem
like
an
innoc
victim
of
her
own
obsess
behaviour
,
at
time
she
's
a
rather
tragic
charact
,
and
more
often
than
not
she
's
just
damn
scari
!
This
is
basic
a
veri
simpl
tale
,
but
it
achiev
a
larg
degre
of
eloqu
in
it
simplic
.
It
's
an
involv
,
engross
experience-and
consid
it
's
basic
a
two-hand
,
main
set
in
one
local
,
it
's
a
remark
piec
of
cinema
.
There
are
no
jazzi
special
effect
or
cheesi
action
sequences-thi
one
reli
sole
upon
Rob
Reiner
's
stylish
direct
and
the
wonder
perform
of
Bate
and
Caan
.
Oh
,
I
have
n't
realli
mention
Caan
yet-h
doe
a
good
job
as
the
writer
who
's
a
prison
of
his
own
success
-LRB-
Annie
is
obsess
with
him
and
his
book
-RRB-
.
But
,
as
you
no
doubt
gather
from
the
above-B
is
well
and
truli
the
star
of
the
show
.
Along
with
the
pig
,
of
cours
!
Anyway
,
the
tension
is
built-up
with
master
aplomb
,
and
some
scene
are
almost
agonis
tens
.
There
's
the
dinner
scene
where
Seldon
goe
to
nerve-shatt
length
to
poison
her
wine
.
He
succeed
,
but
...
she
knock
the
glass
over
!
I
bet
you
threw
a
pillow
at
the
screen
as
well
!
In
the
immort
word
of
Homer
J.
Simpson
-
``
D'OH
!!
''
Other
nerve-wrack
scene
includ
the
bit
where
Annie
has
gone
off
to
town
and
Sheldon
start
snoop
around
the
hous
.
We
cut
to
Annie
in
her
car-sh
's
on
her
way
home
...
he
realis
this
and
tri
to
get
back
to
his
room
...
cut
to
the
car
again
,
she
's
get
near
...
will
he
make
it
?
OK
,
so
these
sequenc
are
n't
exact
origin
,
nor
perhap
unpredictable-but
they
work
!
Boy
,
do
they
work
!
If
a
film
has
you
on
the
edg
of
your
couch
,
bite
your
nail
and
shout
at
the
screen
in
suspens
,
then
it
's
do
someth
right
!
Of
cours
,
the
most
nauseat
sequenc
is
the
aforement
``
hobbl
''
!
Annie
realis
her
captiv
has
been
out
of
his
room
,
and
she
's
go
to
stop
him
onc
and
for
all
.
Cue
a
block
of
wood
place
strateg
between
his
ankl
and
a
huge
sledgehamm
,
and
...
I
feel
ill
just
think
about
it
!
Nasti
.
It
all
build
up
nice
to
the
final
scene
where
Sheldon
final
get
the
upper
hand
,
and
onc
and
for
all
tri
to
kill
the
crazi
psycho
!
And
then
we
re
given
one
of
the
most
ridicul
over-the-top
fight
scene
I
ve
ever
seen
.
She
get
hit
over
the
head
with
a
typewrit
,
set
on
fire
,
head
smash
against
the
wall-and
she
just
wo
n't
die
!
Sheldon
is
n't
in
terribl
good
shape
either
.
If
it
were
n't
so
gorey
it
would
almost
be
laughabl
.
But
it
's
a
terrif
effect
film
,
and
therefor
the
daft
climax
is
easili
overlook
.
MISERi
is
a
tight
,
tens
,
intens
and
chill
entertain
thriller
.
The
direct
is
first-rat
,
and
the
performances-B
in
particular-contribut
to
make
this
a
suitabl
nightmarish
littl
gem
.
Wonder
stuff
.
