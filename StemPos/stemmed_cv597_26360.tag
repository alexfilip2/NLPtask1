show
just
how
unhip
he
is
after
watch
the
kooki
Transylvanian
wrap
up
their
ode
to
the
Time
Warp
in
the
cult
classic
The
Rocki
Horror
Pictur
Show
.
The
stori
behind
The
Rocki
Horror
Pictur
Show
is
one
of
legend
.
In
the
earli
70
's
,
stage
actor
turn
first-tim
playwright
Richard
O'Brien
decid
he
want
to
make
a
music
homag
to
the
crazi
B-movi
he
had
grown
up
with
as
a
child
,
set
to
a
bunch
of
catchi
rock
tune
of
his
own
design
.
The
result
was
the
stage
play
The
Rocki
Horror
Show
,
which
open
to
fair
decent
review
in
London
in
1973
and
was
even
hail
the
Best
Music
of
1973
by
promin
drama
critic
in
England
.
The
play
was
so
success
that
the
film
right
were
immedi
snap
up
and
product
on
the
film
began
a
mere
year
later
,
in
October
of
1974
.
The
film
version
-LRB-
now
titl
The
Rocki
Horror
PICTURE
Show
-RRB-
was
releas
in
1975
...
and
immedi
tank
at
the
box
offic
.
Whether
it
was
becaus
Fox
was
n't
quit
sure
how
to
market
it
to
audienc
or
that
audienc
did
n't
quit
know
what
to
make
of
it
themselv
has
never
realli
been
determin
,
but
the
one
common
bit
of
knowledg
about
the
film
was
that
it
was
a
huge
flop
.
It
seem
that
the
infecti
spirit
brought
about
by
the
stage
version
had
not
been
infus
into
the
film
version
and
Fox
quick
had
it
pull
from
theater
.
A
year
later
,
someth
entir
strang
and
magic
happen
.
Print
of
the
film
start
to
be
distribut
to
theater
in
small
amount
and
were
circul
at
midnight
show
across
the
countri
,
and
it
was
then
that
a
whole
new
audienc
found
the
film
.
This
new
audienc
was
prone
to
dress
up
like
the
charact
from
the
film
,
act
out
segment
in
front
of
the
screen
as
the
movi
play
,
yell
rude
comment
at
the
screen
,
and
just
general
have
a
good
time
.
Word
quick
spread
about
this
new
phenomena
of
interact
film
and
The
Rocki
Horror
Pictur
Show
's
life
as
the
ultim
cult
film
was
born
.
For
the
virgin
out
there
who
are
unawar
,
the
plot
center
around
a
love
coupl
,
Brad
Major
-LRB-
Barri
Bostwick
-RRB-
and
Janet
Weiss
-LRB-
Susan
Sarandon
-RRB-
,
who
come
from
a
small
town
call
Denton
.
Brad
and
Janet
have
just
attend
the
wed
of
two
of
their
friend
and
decid
that
they
also
want
to
be
wed.
.
They
plan
a
trip
to
see
the
man
who
led
to
their
meet
,
Dr.
Everett
Scott
-LRB-
Jonathan
Adam
,
who
play
the
narrat
in
the
origin
stage
version
-RRB-
,
but
their
car
get
a
flat
on
the
way
to
his
home
.
Rememb
a
castl
they
had
seen
back
a
few
mile
down
the
road
,
they
decid
to
walk
there
and
see
if
the
resid
have
a
phone
they
might
be
abl
to
use
to
call
for
assist
.
The
castl
is
actual
the
home
of
a
race
of
alien
from
the
planet
Transsexu
-LRB-
in
the
galaxi
of
Transylvania
-RRB-
,
who
are
lead
by
the
eccentr
fishnet-stock
wear
mad
scientist
Dr.
Frank-N-Furt
-LRB-
Tim
Curri
-RRB-
.
Frank-N-Furt
has
mastermind
the
secret
to
creat
life
and
has
done
so
in
the
form
of
Rocki
-LRB-
Peter
Hinwood
-RRB-
.
As
Rocki
becom
accustom
to
his
new
environ
,
Brad
and
Janet
find
themselv
at
the
merci
of
Frank-N-Furt
's
mad
scheme
.
Littl
do
ani
of
them
know
that
the
doctor
's
handyman
,
Riff-Raff
-LRB-
origin
author
Richard
O'Brien
-RRB-
,
and
domest
,
Magenta
-LRB-
Patricia
Quinn
-RRB-
,
are
actual
Transsexu
planetari
protector
who
have
been
sent
to
stop
Frank
from
spread
his
alien
evil
all
over
the
Earth
.
Go
back
and
revisit
this
film
after
ten
year
-LRB-
1990
be
the
first
time
I
had
ever
seen
it
-RRB-
,
it
is
amaz
to
me
that
this
film
ever
got
made
or
has
had
the
stay
power
that
it
has
.
If
I
had
been
a
Fox
execut
around
the
time
of
it
releas
,
I
do
n't
think
I
would
have
known
what
to
make
of
it
either
.
For
all
intent
and
purpos
it
is
a
bad
movi
-LRB-
though
bad
in
a
realli
good
sort
of
way
-RRB-
,
but
sumptuous
product
design
and
a
great
deal
of
incred
catchi
song
realli
help
to
increas
the
likabl
of
the
film
.
By
the
time
the
credit
role
,
it
is
fair
easi
to
have
gotten
wrap
up
in
the
film
and
it
charact
,
and
one
realli
get
the
feel
that
Richard
O'Brien
definit
was
a
fan
of
the
old
cheesi
B-movi
his
film
is
base
on
.
When
I
say
that
the
wall-to-wal
song
are
catchi
what
I
realli
mean
to
say
is
that
,
onc
you
hear
them
,
they
will
be
ingrain
in
your
head
for
all
of
etern
.
It
goe
without
say
that
the
``
Time
Warp
''
is
the
most
popular
song
in
the
film
.
Even
peopl
who
have
never
seen
the
movi
know
of
that
particular
song
.
What
those
who
have
n't
seen
the
movi
do
n't
know
though
,
is
that
there
are
even
more
song
in
the
film
that
are
just
as
worthi
of
acknowledg
.
My
person
favorit
is
``
Over
at
the
Frankenstein
Place
''
,
but
``
Dammit
Janet
''
is
also
madden
catchi
.
Tim
Curri
's
vocal
on
the
rock
tune
``
Sweet
Transvestit
''
need
to
be
heard
to
be
believ
.
The
final
of
the
film
,
a
big
floor
show
stage
by
Frank-N-Furt
and
featur
most
of
the
cast
in
garter
and
fishnet
-LRB-
includ
Barri
Bostwick
...
frighten
!
-RRB-
,
featur
no
less
than
four
song
-LRB-
``
Rose
Tint
my
World
''
,
``
Do
n't
Dream
It
''
,
``
Wild
and
Untame
Thing
''
,
and
``
I
'm
Go
Home
''
-RRB-
,
all
of
which
are
immens
singabl
.
The
film
's
true
popular
and
longev
resid
in
it
audienc
particip
though
.
Despit
the
catchi
of
the
song
,
this
movi
would
have
been
long
forgotten
about
if
it
had
n't
have
been
for
the
multitud
of
folk
who
dress
up
everi
Friday
or
Saturday
night
to
rush
out
and
be
a
part
of
their
own
littl
floor
show
.
Watch
this
film
at
home
is
noth
compar
to
actual
experienc
this
in
a
theater
with
hundr
of
rabid
fan
-LRB-
unless
you
do
n't
mind
invit
friend
over
and
let
them
shoot
water
gun
in
your
home
or
let
them
throw
rice
and
piec
of
toast
all
over
the
place
-RRB-
.

so
mani
extra
that
it
ll
take
a
good
eight
hour
just
to

in
the
major
of

all
.
The

lower
left
corner
-RRB-
which
present
the
film
in
the
manner
it
was
origin
suppos
to
have
been
seen
.
Origin
,
the
film
was
to
have
been
similar
to
The
Wizard
of
Oz
,
with
the
first
half
of
the
it
seen
in
black
and
white
-LRB-
and

to
color
until
the
Transylvanian
are
first
reveal
to

and
Janet
dure
the
Time
Warp
music
number
-RRB-
.
Most
report
,
includ
a
documentari
on
the
disc
,
say
that
the
color
was
suppos
to
appear
when
Frank-N-Furt
first
show
up
in
the
elev
,
but
it
doe
seem
to
work
better
where
it
was
place
on
this
version
,
depict
the
vast
differ
between
the
world
Brad
and
Janet
were
use
to
compar
with
the
one
to
which
they
are
introduc

The
film
contain
a
commentari
track
by
show
creator
-LRB-
and
faith
handyman
-RRB-
Richard
O'Brien
and
co-star
Patricia
Quinn
which
is
fair
enjoy
-LRB-
and
Quinn
immedi
start
off
by
refus
to
speak
about
Sarandon
near
contract
pneumonia
while
have
to
walk
around
wet
and
half-nak
on
freez
cold
set
,
which
she
appar
complain
about
the
entir
film
and
in
futur
interview
-RRB-
.
The

seem
like
old
friend
and
have
great
stori
to
tell
,
but
they
also
point
out
cast
member
that
are
sad
no
longer
with
us
anymor
-LRB-
and
there
are
quit
a
few
-RRB-

also
tri
to

the
feel
of
attend
the

in
a

with
sever
audienc
particip
segment

The
first
featur
-LRB-

particip
track
,
which
let
you

on
what
you
might

Most

unintellig
becaus
it
is
basic
just
a
larg
group
of
peopl
scream
their
head
off
,
but
everi
onc
and
a
while
a
comment
can
be
heard
that
will
invok
a
bit
of
laughter
.
The
final
