Arnold
Schwarzenegg
has
been
an
icon
for
action
enthusiast
,
sinc
the
late
80
's
,
but
late
his
film
have
been
veri
sloppi
and
the
one-lin
are
get
wors
.
It
's
hard
see
Arnold
as
Mr.
Freez
in
Batman
And
Robin
,
especi
when
he
say
ton
of
ice
joke
,
but
hey
he
gotmillion
,
what
's
it
matter
to
him
?
Once
again
Arnold
has
sign
to
do
anoth
expens
blockbust
,
that
ca
n't
compar
with
the
like
of
The
Termin
seri
,
True
Lie
and
even
Eraser
.
In
this
so
call
dark
thriller
,
the
devil
-LRB-
Gabriel
Byrn
-RRB-
has
come
upon
earth
,
to
impregn
a
woman
-LRB-
Robin
Tunney
-RRB-
which
happen
everi
1000
year
,
and
basic
destroy
the
world
,
but
appar
God
has
chosen
one
man
,
and
that
one
man
is
Jericho
Cane
-LRB-
Arnold
himself
-RRB-
.
With
the
help
of
a
trusti
sidekick
-LRB-
Kevin
Pollack
-RRB-
,
they
will
stop
at
noth
to
let
the
devil
take
over
the
world
!
Part
of
this
are
actual
so
absurd
,
that
they
would
fit
right
in
with
Dogma
.
yes
,
the
film
is
that
weak
,
but
it
's
better
than
the
other
blockbust
right
now
-LRB-
Sleepi
Hollow
-RRB-
,
but
it
make
The
World
Is
Not
Enough
look
like
a
4
star
film
.
Anyway
,
this
definit
doe
n't
seem
like
an
Arnold
movi
.
It
just
was
n't
the
type
of
film
you
can
see
him
do
.
Sure
he
gave
us
a
few
chuckl
with
his
well
known
one-lin
,
but
he
seem
confus
as
to
where
his
charact
and
the
film
was
go
.
It
's
understand
,
especi
when
the
end
had
to
be
chang
accord
to
some
sourc
.
Aside
form
that
,
he
still
walk
through
it
,
much
like
he
has
in
the
past
few
film
.
I
'm
sorri
to
say
this
Arnold
but
mayb
these
are
the
end
of
your
action
day
.
Speak
of
action
,
where
was
it
in
this
film
?
There
was
hard
ani
explos
or
fight
.
The
devil
made
a
few
place
explod
,
but
Arnold
was
n't
kick
some
devil
butt
.
The
end
was
chang
to
make
it
more
spiritu
,
which
undoubt
ruin
the
film
.
I
was
at
least
hope
for
a
cool
end
if
noth
els
occur
,
but
onc
again
I
was
let
down
.
I
also
do
n't
know
whi
the
film
took
so
long
and
cost
so
much
.
There
was
realli
no
super
affect
at
all
,
unless
you
consid
an
invis
devil
,
who
was
in
it
forminut
top
,
worth
the
overpr
budget
.
The
budget
should
have
gone
into
a
better
script
,
where
at
least
audienc
could
be
somewhat
entertain
instead
of
face
boredom
.
It
's
piti
to
see
how
script
like
these
get
bought
and
made
into
a
movi
.
Do
they
even
read
these
thing
anymor
?
It
sure
doe
n't
seem
like
it
.
Thank
Gabriel
's
perform
gave
some
light
to
this
poor
film
.
When
he
walk
down
the
street
search
for
Robin
Tunney
,
you
ca
n't
help
but
feel
that
he
look
like
a
devil
.
The
guy
is
creepi
look
anyway
!
When
it
's
all
over
,
you
re
just
glad
it
's
the
end
of
the
movi
.
Do
n't
bother
to
see
this
,
if
you
re
expect
a
solid
action
flick
,
becaus
it
's
neither
solid
nor
doe
it
have
action
.
It
's
just
anoth
movi
that
we
are
sucker
in
to
see
,
due
to
a
strateg
market
campaign
.
Save
your
money
and
see
the
World
Is
Not
Enough
for
an
entertain
experi
.
