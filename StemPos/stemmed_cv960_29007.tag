-LRB-
Paul
Guilfoyl
-RRB-
,
bring
them
through
some
of
the
creepier
part
of
the
former
asylum
.
But
,
a
job
is
a
job
and
,
if
they
finish
in
a
week
,
as
promis
,
there
is
a
$
10000
bonus
in
store
.
As
they
get
down
to
their
work
,
thing
,
normal
and
not
so
normal
,
begin
to
happen
.
Gordon
hear
a
disembodi
voic
beckon
him
.
Phil
-LRB-
David
Caruso
-RRB-
is
conflict
work
with
a
guy
,
Hank
-LRB-
Josh
Luca
-RRB-
,
who
is
see
his
old
girlfriend
.
Mike
-LRB-
co-screenwrit
Steven
Gevedon
-RRB-
has
discov
a
cach
of
audiotap
and
transcript
from
old
psychiatr
session
-LRB-
henc
,
the
titl
-RRB-
with
inmat
Mari
Hobb
,
a
multi-person
patient
with
a
dark
secret
.
Gordo
's
nephew
,
Jeff
-LRB-
Brendan
Sexton
III
-RRB-
,
suffer
from
night
phobia
and
is
afraid
to
ventur
into
the
dark
bowel
of
the
hospit
.
As
the
agre
upon
week
draw
to
an
end
,
Hank
mysteri
disappear
from
the
workplac
after
a
nocturn
confront
with
someon
-LRB-
someth
?
-RRB-
in
the
hospit
.
Tension
mount
and
distrust
build
among
the
rest
as
they
watch
their
chanc
for
the
bonus
start
to
slip
away
.
But
,
there
is
more
,
much
more
,
at
stake
as
the
hospit
and
it
histori
of
insan
weigh
on
them
all
.
I
do
n't
want
to
give
away
too
much
of
the
stori
of
``
Session
9
,
''
so
I
ll
stop
there
.
What
we
have
here
is
a
spooki
horror
flick
that
use
none
of
the
jump-out-at-you-from-the-dark
cheap
shot
that
have
becom
part
and
parcel
with
horror
film
sinc
the
advent
of
``
Halloween
''
and
``
Friday
the
Thirteenth
.
''
There
is
no
cat
leap
out
of
the
dark
or
the
shock
of
sudden
see
oneself
in
a
strateg
place
mirror
.
With
the
except
of
one
shadowi
and
chill
imag
at
one
point
spooki
interlud
in
the
film
,
there
is
littl
that
you
can
get
your
arm
around
as
far
as
what
,
specif
,
is
``
frighten
.
''
As
I
watch
``
Session
9
''
I
becam
awar
of
the
subtl
thing
that
built
up
dure
the
stori
that
make
it
a
true
horror
movi
.
The
strike
high-definit
video
camera
work
by
Uta
Briesewitz
-LRB-
who
work
with
the
director
,
Brad
Anderson
,
on
his
``
Next
Stop
Wonderland
''
-RRB-
help
to
build
up
tension
with
close-up
,
fluid
camera
movement
and
odd
angl
in
a
way
that
would
make
Alfred
Hitchcock
proud
.
Music
,
too
,
is
use
to
intens
effect
,
join
with
the
camera
to
make
simpl
scene
frighten
,
even
horrifi
.
Coupl
these
tech
feat
with
an
intellig
stori
that
use
element
of
``
The
Shine
,
''
``
The
Blair
Witch
Project
''
and
,
even
``
The
Texa
Chainsaw
Massacr
''
and
you
get
a
decent
,
intrigu
horror
flick
.
Addition
,
the
brilliant
decis
to
shoot
at
Danver
State
Hospit
give
the
film
anoth
star
charact
,
the
institut
itself
,
which
lend
even
more
chill
to
the
equat
.
Acting
is
anoth
factor
that
rais
``
Session
9
''
abov
the
usual
dreck
present
in
recent
horror
hit
like
``
Scream
,
''
``
I
Know
What
you
Did
Last
Summer
''
and
their
sequel
.
Those
film
took
good-look
,
though
generic
,
young
actor
and
actress
and
put
them
to
use
to
build
up
a
bodi
count
,
substitut
mayhem
for
real
horror
.
Anderson
opt
,
instead
,
to
use
matur
,
experienc
actor
like
Peter
Mullan
and
David
Caruso
to
fill
his
charact
'
shoe
and
the
differ
in
cast
qualiti
is
notabl
.
Mullan
,
in
particular
,
put
an
arc
on
his
charact
,
Gordon
,
as
the
troubl
guy
who
slowli
and
inexor
fall
under
the
pressur
of
famili
,
job
and
,
final
,
Danver
State
Hospit
.
The
rest
of
the
small
cast
fit
the
bill
as
peopl
,
not
just
fodder
for
the
mayhem
.
David
Caruso
,
as
Gordo
's
senior
man
and
near
equal
in
the
busi
,
show
just
how
good
an
actor
he
is
.
He
made
the
jump
from
TV
's
``
NyPD
Blue
''
to
film
far
too
soon
and
his
decis
in
the
role
he
took
-LRB-
I
ll
never
forget
the
horrend
``
Jade
''
-RRB-
were
less
than
star
make
.
He
roll
his
sleev
up
and
doe
the
job
well
here
.
Gevedon
,
Luca
and
Sexton
are
more
than
fodder
,
too
.
The
onli
problem
with
``
Session
9
''
lay
in
the
uninspir
end
.
It
take
on
a
fair
convent
final
that
cover
old
ground
and
is
a
bit
of
a
disappoint
after
the
terrif
-LRB-
and
inspir
-RRB-
build
up
.
The
pleasur
is
get
there
and
I
wish
that
Anderson
and
Gevedon
had
kept
up
the
steam
they
had
so
abli
built
dure
the
bulk
of
the
film
``
Session
9
''
is
an
unusu
feat
.
It
is
scari
,
doe
n't
use
cheap
trick
and
rais
goos
bump
with
it
intellig
render
,
subtl
horror
.
Becaus
of
the
local
interest
of
Danver
,
it
should
do
well
with
the
Northeast
crowd
.
I
hope
it
get
the
nation
distribut
it
deserv
.
