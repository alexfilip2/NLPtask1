Kid
today
,
they
do
n't
just
want
to
see
heartthrob
and
master
thespian
Freddi
Prinz
Jr.
love
on
the
ladi
.
No
,
they
want
to
see
him
do
someth
that
take
a
littl
more
in
the
act
depart
:
name
,
play
basebal
.
Through
a
seri
of
drippi
voiceov
,
we
are
inform
that
there
's
no
better
prove
ground
for
Major
Leagu
Basebal
than
the
Cape
Cod
summer
basebal
leagu
,
where
colleg
also-ran
and
hope
dropout
go
to
play
in
the
hope
of
attract
big
leagu
attent
.
Our
man
Freddi
has
land
a
spot
as
a
pitcher
on
the
prestigi
Chatham
A
's
,
where
he
is
hope
for
his
big
break
.
It
's
onli
after
he
is
given
ampl
time
to
show
off
his
ab
and
scamper
about
in
a
woman
's
thong
-LRB-
do
n't
ask
-RRB-
that
we
learn
what
the
real
stori
of
Summer
Catch
will
be
:
That
Prinz
is
a
poor
towni
name
Ryan
Dunn
,
struggl
to
make
a
name
for
himself
;
that
neither
his
father
-LRB-
Fred
Ward
-RRB-
nor
brother
-LRB-
Jason
Gedrick
-RRB-
pull
themselv
out
of
their
blue
collar
job
and
resent
anyon
who
tri
;
and
that
the
local
beauti
Tenley
--
Tenley
!
-LRB-
Jessica
Biel
-RRB-
--
is
so
far
out
of
his
leagu
that
he
probabl
should
n't
even
bother
...
but
of
cours
he
make
a
play
for
her
.
Summer
Catch
also
make
an
abort
stab
at
anoth
half
a
dozen
subplot
--
the
jealousi
of
fellow
towni
and
brazen
slut
Dee
Dee
-LRB-
Brittani
Murphi
-RRB-
,
the
alien
felt
by
Ryan
's
non-basebal
play
best
friend
-LRB-
Gabriel
Mann
-RRB-
,
or
the
fat
chick
fetish
of
fellow
player
Mile
-LRB-
Marc
Bluca
-RRB-
.
Worst
of
these
is
a
ludicr
bit
involv
That
70s
Show
's
Wilmer
Valderrama
and
Bever
D'Angelo
,
both
of
whom
appear
in
the
film
simpli
to
provid
a
nutti
Mrs.
Robinson-lik
substori
and
to
remind
you
of
how
much
better
done
that
was
in
Bull
Durham
.
In
fact
,
virtual
all
of
Summer
Catch
feel
like
it
's
been
done
better
somewher
els
.
For
starter
,
the
film
has
a
major
question
of
ident
.
It
's
definit
not
a
sport
movi
,
and
it
fail
pretti
miser
at
be
a
romanc
.
The
worst
part
is
the
amateurish
script
-LRB-
co-written
by
an
Arli
$
$
write
alumnus
and
a
guy
that
star
in
Leprechaun
3
-RRB-
,
chock-ful
of
phoni
emot
.
By
the
end
,
it
all
becom
a
platform
for
each
charact
to
deliv
a
soliloquy
to
Ryan
that
he
must
take
to
heart
.
Dad
is
on
hand
to
give
father
yet
drunken
advic
.
Coach
-LRB-
Brian
Dennehi
,
just
love
the
fact
that
he
's
got
some
work
on
the
big
screen
-RRB-
is
on
hand
to
give
the
curmudgeon
counterpoint
.
Ryan
's
catcher
-LRB-
Matthew
Lillard
,
play
himself
again
-RRB-
is
on
hand
to
tell
Ryan
to
``
play
catch
''
with
him
and
make
fun
of
the
fat
fetish
guy
.
Ryan
's
stoner
best
friend
is
on
hand
to
give
the
go-get
-
em
-
tiger-w
re
-
behind-you
talk
.
And
the
girlfriend
is
on
hand
to
give
heartwarming-nuzzly-follow-your-dream
counsel
.
Befor
long
,
you
start
to
wonder
:
Is
Freddi
Prinz
Jr.
is
capabl
of
have
a
thought
of
his
own
?
The
onli
real
joy
in
the
film
is
found
in
Biel
's
charact
,
and
not
just
becaus
of
the
skimpi
outfit
,
which
are
also
usual
wet
.
She
's
the
onli
one
in
the
movi
that
is
abl
to
do
much
with
her
role
,
take
the
rebelling-against-daddi
charact
to
at
least
a
pass
grade
.
When
she
's
on
screen
,
the
time
fli
by
.
When
she
's
not
,
you
realiz
that
for
some
ungod
reason
this
movi
is
almost
two
hour
long
.
For
a
PG-13
teen
romanc
-LRB-
despit
near-const
sexual
innuendo
-RRB-
,
one
has
to
ask
Warner
Brother
:
what
were
you
think
???
For
her
part
,
Biel
has
fallen
so
far
from
her
7th
Heaven
root
that
she
has
almost
becom
Denis
Richard
.
Hollywood
is
either
about
to
eat
her
aliv
...
or
vice
versa
.
Either
way
,
good
luck
,
Jessica
.
As
for
Freddi
,
if
he
keep
pump
teen
romanc
out
at
the
rate
of
two
a
year
,
Prinz
's
next
``
summer
catch
''
is
liabl
to
be
a
vener
diseas
.
