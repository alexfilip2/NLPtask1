When

,
Alex

and
a
teacher

The

off
without

and
explod
just
as
Alex
predict
.
He

an
object
of
fear
and
suspicion

clue
them
in
to
the
truth
:
Alex
interrupt
Death
's
design
by
save
peopl
who
should
have
die
in
the
explos
,
and
Death
will
want
to
claim
it
right
victim
.
In
order
to
save
himself
and
the
other
,
Alex
will
have
to
figur
out
Death
's
new
plan
and
thwart
it
.
Of
the
countless
horror
film
that
have
compet
for
a
piec
of
the
``
Scream
''
audienc
,
``
Final
Destin
''
is
the
best
so
far
.
Talent
young
screenwrit
Jeffrey
Reddick
offer
a
fresh
variat
on
a
familiar
formula
.
We
ve
seen
hundr
of
movi
where
a
group
of
teenag
are
murder
one-by-on
by
a
faceless
slasher
,
but
Reddick
cut
out
the
hockey-mask
middle-man
and
make
the
villain
Death
itself
.
First-tim
featur
director
Jame
Wong
made
the
most
of
that
premis
.
Everi
scene
is
permeat
with
creepi
and
forebod
,
remind
us
that
Death
is
everywher
,
can
come
at
anytim
.
Everyday
object
and
event
vibrat
with
menac
.
The
most
amus
harbing
of
doom
:
John
Denver
's
``
Rocki
Mountain
High
,
''
which
is
play
sever
time
in
the
movi
befor
someon
die
.
-LRB-
The
link
is
that
Denver
die
in
a
plane
crash
,
and
the
song
includ
a
line
about
fire
in
the
sky
.
-RRB-
The
perform
are
stronger
than
those
usual
elicit
by
teen
horror
.
Devon
Sawa
,
who
previous
star
in
anoth
horror
flick
,
``
Idle
Hand
,
''
give
a
frantic
and
convinc
lead
perform
.
Kerr
Smith
is
Carter
Hogan
,
an
antagonist
of
Alex
's
whose
quick
temper
caus
him
to
pull
off
the
fatal
plane
.
Smith
play
Carter
as
fill
with
anger
and
confus
that
constant
threaten
to
bubbl
over
into
violenc
.
Seann
William
Scott
,
who
's
also
in
theater
right
now
in
``
Road
Trip
,
''
play
the
somewhat
dim
Billi
Hitchcock
and
provid
a
need
counterpoint
to
the
intens
of
Alex
and
Carter
.
Toni
Todd
's
one-scen
cameo
is
delici
but
all
too
brief
.
Bottom
line
:
Watchabl
teen
fright
flick
are
few
and
far
between
,
but
this
destin
is
worth
visit
.
