The

releas
of
this
film
from
Elite
Entertain
contain
the
film
in
it
's
origin
aspect
ratio
of
1.33:1
.
The

two
version
of
the
film
's
audio
:
a
stereo
2.0
track
and
a
newli
remast
Dolbi

.
Include
are
two
separ
run
commentari
track
:
the
first
featur
writer/director
Sam
Raimi
and
produc
Rob
Tapert
and
the
second
track
featur
the
film
's
star
,
Bruce
Campbel
.
Campbel
's
commentari
is
inform
and
extrem
witti
,
as
he
has
a
stori
to
tell
for
virtual
everi
scene
in
the
film
.
Such
inform
tidbit
includ
:
The
origin
titl
of
the
film
was
go
to
be
Book
of
the
Dead
-LRB-
and
in
fact
when
the
film
premier
in
1981
that
was
it
's
titl
-RRB-
and
when
they
were
ask
to
chang
the
titl
to
The
Evil
Dead
,
everyon
thought
it
was
the
worst
titl
they
had
ever
heard
.
Also
,
there
's
a
scene
earli
on
in
the
film
where
the
group
sit
around
and
listen
to
a
tape
record
which
they
ve
found
that
's
explain
about
the
demon
forc
in
the
wood
.
For
that
scene
,
it
was
written
for
the
charact
to
be
smoke
marijuana
,
so
be
the
wacki
kid
that
they
were
at
the
time
,
they
decid
to
actual
smoke
marijuana
for
the
scene
.
Almost
all
of
that
footag
becam
unus
becaus
mani
of
the
actor
's
had
never
smoke
befor
,
and
as
a
result
they
becam
``
confus
''
and
were
unabl
to
perform
the
scene
.
I
wish
the
entertain
factor
was
as
high
for
the
Sam
Raimi/Rob
Tapert
audio
track
.
The
two
peopl
you
'd
think
would
be
more
enthusiast
in
talk
about
this
film
instead
bare
have
much
to
say
at
all
.
Do
n't
get
me
wrong
here
,
when
they
do
speak
it
's
entertain
to
hear
,
but
there
are
mani
instanc
where
both
are
silent
for
long
period
of
time
.
Sometim
after
one
of
those
long
silenc
Rob
will
ask
``
Have
anyth
to
say
Sam
?
''
To
me
,
that
's
not
a
good
sign
.
Also
,
it
seem
like
Sam
Raimi
doe
n't
rememb
much
about
the
film
and
it
's
product
...
well
,
compar
to
Rob
and
Bruce
anyway
.
Also
includ
on
the
disc
is
a
photo
galleri
-LRB-
which
includ
pictur
from
the
film
's
``
gala
''
premier
-RRB-
and
about
twenti
minut
of
raw
footag
from
the
film
.
This
raw
footag
realli
show
you
how
much
a
film
can
be
improv
upon
use
simpl
audio
techniqu
.
Overal
,
The
Evil
Dead
is
a
good
low
budget
horror
film
,
superior
to
mani
film
in
it
's
genr
.
And
the
collector
's
edit
DVD
releas
is
well
worth
your
time
if
you
re
either
a
fan
of
the
film
or
just
a
fan
of
the
filmmak
process
.
All
special
edit
DVDs
should
be
this
thorough
and
entertain
.
