Opinion
:
Everi
time
peopl
watch
movi
that
portray
anim
as
be
with
cute
human
person
,
some
well-mean
audienc
member
go
out
next
Christma
or
birthday
and
buy
a
Dalmatian
or
whatev
creatur
is
current
popular
.
Soon
enough
,
``
birthday
kid
''
lose
interest
and
the
purchas
pup
end
up
at
the
local
pound
,
a
victim
of
neglect
.
My
sister
own
a
real
PAULIE
:
it
think
like
a
parrot
,
bite
like
a
parrot
,
and
requir
as
much
attent
as
a
newborn
human
infant
.
Pleas
think
twice
befor
buy
one
.
Okay
.
Back
to
the
stori
.
In
movi
,
parrot
usual
play
support
charact
,
but
PAULIE
might
be
the
first
movi
where
the
-LRB-
animatron
-RRB-
bird
get
main
bill
.
Pauli
,
like
those
side
charact
in
Disney
cartoon
,
is
cute
and
sassi
,
a
strut
,
miniatur
human
.
Actualli
,
Pauli
is
the
voic
of
Jay
Mohr
-LRB-
he
play
Jennif
Aniston
's
boyfriend
on
PICTURE
PERFECT
-RRB-
do
his
best
Buddi
Hackett
impress
-LRB-
which
is
interest
,
sinc
Hackett
himself
cameo
as
the
pawn
shop
owner
,
and
Mohr
doubl
as
a
custom
-RRB-
.
PAULIE
is
for
kid
.
While
watch
PAULIE
you
hear
littl
tyke
in
the
theater
laugh
hyster
when
Pauli
call
the
cat
a
``
stupid
furbal
.
''
Sometim
,
howev
,
there
are
statement
the
kid
do
n't
get
.
For
exampl
,
when
Pauli
's
elder
owner
Ivi
-LRB-
Gena
Rowland
-RRB-
die
,
Pauli
explain
,
``
Well
,
one
day
,
the
cat
got
her
.
''
And
you
hear
kid
exclaim
,
``
What
cat
?!
''
Imagin
LASSIE
COME
HOME
,
except
with
a
doll-siz
human
dress
as
a
bird
,
and
you
ll
have
a
good
idea
of
the
plot
and
character

Bird
lose
elder

Bird
meet
eccentr
friend
.
Bird
lose

.
Bird
meet

And
so
on
and
so
forth
,
with
Pauli
meet
friend
and
say
goodby
at
a
meander
pace
until
he
final

.
The
bottom
line

Break
out

Mom
and
Dad
.
PAULIE
may
be
the
low
end
version
of
LASSIE
,
BAMBI
,
or
BABE
,
but
he
ll
do
.
Sometim
the
wisecrack

their
head
,
but
I
'm
sure

appreci
a
stori
about
a
littl
person
-LRB-
Pauli
-RRB-
tri
to
get
home
,
meet
friend
and
experienc
moral
lesson
on
the
way
.
And
good

what
it
mean
when
Pauli
say
of
Ivi
,
``

,
one
day
,
the
cat
got
her
