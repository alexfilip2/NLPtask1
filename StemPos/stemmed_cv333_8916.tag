It

a
spark
of
excit
in
what
otherwis
has
been
a

for
independ

Have
endur
my
share
of
the
hype
,
I
wait
calm
for
MEN
to
reach
the
hinterland
wherein
I
resid
,
and
then
check
in
to
see
what
all
the
fuss
was
about
.
Doe
MEN
live
up
to
it
press
?
Well
,
yes
it
doe
.
And
it
may
make
you
think
twice
befor
you

For
the
uniniti
,
newcom
Aaron
Eckhart
and
Matt
Malloy
play
Chad
and
Howard
,
two
corpor
drone
who
are
dispatch
by
their
nameless
compani
to
a
remot
branch
offic
for
a
six
week
assign
.
Chad
and
Howard
are
archetyp
,
exampl
of
which
you
can
no
doubt
find
in
your
own
place
of
busi
.
Chad
is
the
blond
golden
boy
,
genet
engin
for
success
,
the
natur
charmer
who
seem
to
glide
effortless
up
the
corpor
ladder
.
Howard
is
Chad
's
boss
,
but
he
is
weaker
of
will
,
the
clumsi
practition
of
offic
polit
who
has
achiev
his
posit
through
dog
persist
rather
than
raw
talent
.
We
first
meet
them
await
their
flight
in
a
drab
airport
loung
.
There
Chad
suggest
a
scheme
worthi
of
a
Shakespearean
villain
:
he
and
Howard
will
find
a
vulner
singl
woman
at
the
branch
offic
,
woo
her
simultan
,
win
her
love
,
and
then
dump
her
.
The
reason
?
Both
men
have
recent
been
dump
themselv
,
and
Chad
see
an
easi
rout
to
reveng
against
the
fairer
sex
.
``
It
ll
restor
a
littl
digniti
to
our
live
,
''
he
say
.
Howard
,
helpless
against
the
forc
of
Chad
's
will
,
agre
to
the
plan
.
They
quick
spot
their
prey
in
the
form
of
Christin
-LRB-
Staci
Edward
-RRB-
,
a
fragil
deaf
woman
work
as
a
temp
.
Chad
move
in
for
the
kill
,
flash
his
golden
boy
smile
,
pli
Christin
with
lunch
,
then
flower
,
then
dinner
.
Howard
follow
suit
,
though
his
effort
are
in
contrast
ham-hand
and
desper
.
Flatter
to
have
the
attent
of
two
elig
men
,
Christin
date
them
both
.
you
can
guess
which
one
she
fall
for
.
Soon
a
tragic
lover
'
triangl
develop
:
Christin
love
Chad
,
Chad
love
himself
,
and
Howard
love
Christin
on
the
ground
that
,
sinc
she
's
handicap
and
shi
,
she
just
might
be
wretch
and
lone
enough
to
settl
for
him
.
Adult
social
interact
never
realli
progress
beyond
the
level
of
junior
high
,
doe
it
?
In
Chad
,
writer/director
LaBut
and
actor
Eckhart
have
creat
one
of
the
most
chill
monster
ever
commit
to
film-Hannib
Lector
may
eat
human
flesh
,
but
Chad
is
an
eater
of
soul
.
His
evil
is
as
subtl
as
a
viper
's
,
and
as
easi
as
his
smile
.
We
watch
in
stun
disbelief
as
he
back-stab
cowork
,
humili
his
subordin
,
and
work
his
dead
venom
into
Christin
's
heart
.
His
charact
would
be
a
joke
if
he
was
n't
so
chill
real-al
of
us
have
work
with
a
Chad
,
and
some
of
us
may
be
him
.
He
's
the
guy
who
take
your
job
and
then
laugh
at
you
for
your
weak
.
If
one
of
his
co-work
should
happen
to
go
postal
and
walk
into
the
offic
with
a
bag
full
of
handgun
,
he
had
best
have
his
escap
rout
clear
in
mind
.
Polit
is
his
game
,
and
the
modern
cubicle-fil
offic
is
his
playground
.
MEN
wear
the
guis
of
a
black
comedi
,
but
it
function
best
as
allegori
.
The
most
controversi
moment
in
the
film
happen
when
Chad
humili
a
black
temp
by
ask
him
how
bad
he
want
to
succeed
in
the
compani
,
then
forc
him
to
prove
it
in
a
manner
I
wo
n't
describ
.
The
scene
is
charg
with
racism
and
fraught
with
peril
.
Could
it
happen
in
the
real
world
?
Probabl
not
.
Taken
as
allegori
,
howev
,
it
is
repres
of
the
treatment
of
the
meek
by
the
power
in
all
facet
of
societi
.
Mayb
it
's
just
the
English
major
in
me
,
but
Chad
,
in
his
motiveless
cruelti
toward
Christin
and
his
care
manipul
of
Howard
,
can
be
seen
as
a
symbol
of
unbridl
capit
,
of
greed
without
conscienc
.
The
entir
film
is
a
metaphor
for
social
Darwinism-on
the
strong
will
surviv
.
The
marvel
of
LaBut
's
multi-lay
script
is
that
it
can
disturb
each
member
of
it
audienc
in
an
entir
differ
way
.
But
doe
the
film
work
as
entertain
?
Its
darn
funni
in
spot
,
particular
in
the
men
's
room
scene
,
which
demonstr
the
length
to
which
guy
will
go
to
hold
a
convers
while
engag
in
the
most
basic
of
bodili
function
.
It
work
less
well
as
drama
,
sinc
by
necess
the
charact
in
an
allegori
tend
to
be
flat
cipher
.
Staci
Edward
give
a
measur
digniti
to
Christin
,
and
succeed
in
make
us
care
for
her
,
but
by
the
end
of
the
film
we
still
know
noth
about
her
.
Likewis
,
Chad
and
Howard
are
simpli
the
sum
of
their
action
.
By
the
end
of
the
film
you
ll
feel
as
if
you
ve
met
a
genuin
monster
in
Chad
;
perhap
we
can
also
classifi
MEN
as
a
horror
film
.
Certain
those
expect
a
convent
Hollywood
resolut
to
the
stori
will
walk
away
disappoint
.
But
the
pictur
is
often
mesmer
,
and
the
script
is
a
work
of
fine
craftsmanship
,
which
make
it
well
worth
your
time
.
Like
all
good
film
,
it
offer
a
myriad
of
parallel
to
the
outsid
world
.
While
watch
Chad
in
his
moment
of
triumph
,
I
could
n't
help
but
think
that
Bill
Gate
must
have
felt
the
same
sort
of
cold
,
merciless
satisfact
when
he
final
stuck
it
to
Steve
Job
.
There
may
be
a
littl
bit
of
Chad
in
all
of
us
,
but
some
of
us
have
taken
Chad-
to
the
level
of
art
.
